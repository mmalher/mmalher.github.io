                <p>All poems occur as DIV0. Sonnets are attributed as "type=sonnets"; the rest are
                    "type=poem". All quotation marks, hyphens, dashes, apostrophes and colons have
                    been transcribed as entity references. All &lt;lg&gt; (line groups) are
                    attributed as cantos, stanzas, couplets, verse paragraphs, etc. All poems with
                    regularly indented lines use the attribute "rend" in the &lt;l&gt; tag,
                    with the value "indent1" for one tab stop, "indent2" for two tab stops, etc. All
                    split lines are attributed as "type=i" for the initial portion, and "type=f" for
                    the final portion.</p>
                <p>All apostrophes and single right quotation marks are encoded as
                    &amp;rsquo;.</p>
                <p>Any hyphens occurring in line breaks have been removed; all hyphens are encoded
                    as &amp;hyphen; and em dashes as &amp;mdash;.</p>
                <p>The publisher's advertisement, beginning after p. 181, has been omitted.</p>

                                <emph>NOTE TO UNDINÃ</emph>
                            </p>
                            <p>These UndinÃ©s, or Ocean Nymphs, according to the Northern Mythology,
                                are gentle, beautiful, harmless creations in the form of woman, but
                                without a soul. They can attain this only by union with a mortal,
                                and as they have a passionate desire to ascend into the higher life
                                of humanity, they seek such earthly unions, not guilefully, like the
                                Sirens, but lovingly, aspiringly, as the human might aspire to the
                                angel. It is a beautiful mythus, and veils a deep and profound
                                meaning. De La Motte FouquÃ© has made it familiar to all readers by
                                his exquisite romance of âUndinÃ©,â and Bulwer has revealed some of
                                the hidden truths shadowed forth by the fable, in his two novels of
                                âErnest Maltraversâ and âAliceâânamely, the power of love to create
                                an intellect, in fact, a <emph rend="i">soul</emph> in woman. For,
                                to the deepâthinking, closeâobserving psychologist, there is no
                                truth more evident than that, under the influence of love, a womanâs
                                intellect, <choice>
                                    <corr>genius</corr>
                                    <sic>genuis</sic>
                                </choice>, energy, all the powers of her mind seem capable of
                                infinite expansion. And just in proportion as love has need of them,
                                do the particular qualities start into life and unimagined vigour;
                                be it fortitude, heroism, mental energy, even physical courage, love
                                seems to have the power to create them all. Nothing is impossible to
                                a woman that <emph rend="i">loves</emph>, as nothing is impossible
                                to a man who <emph rend="i">wills</emph>. Another truth is
                                symbolised in this ocean hieroglyphicânamely, that it is the
                                instinct of a womanâs nature to aspire, while the instinct of a
                                manâs nature is to deteriorateâto gravitate towards the animal, to a
                                lower sphere of existence. Woman always loves heavenward; she has
                                the instinct of ascension like flame and ether. Man always loves
                                earthward; he gravitates to earth, not to spirit: so that we may
                                formulize thus:âLove gives soul to a woman, but takes it from a man.
                                This is assuming what, indeed, is true, that man always bestows his
                                love, by preference, on fair UndinÃ©s without souls. When united to
                                such he necessarily divides his soul with her, for all things in
                                nature tend to an equalization, and as he gives half so he loses
                                half. What the result would be if a man of genius wedded a priestess
                                of the eternal fire we have no means of ascertaining; for history
                                contains no solitary instance of<pb n="136" xml:id="VAB7166-134"/> a
                                man of genius becoming united to his equal: that true correlative of
                                his soul, of which Plato speaks, but which no one, so destiny seems
                                to decree, shall ever find on earth. </p>
                            <p>We may imagine, indeed, the possibility of a beautiful, lofty,
                                soaring spirit, standing ever beside man in the combat of life. A
                                serene influence, almost as invisible, yet as sustaining as the
                                ether of heaven, filling him with all divine impulses, strengthening
                                all his noble aspirations, exciting his spirit upwards by all rich
                                and radiant foreshadowings of glory, as Minerva stood, bright in
                                deity, yet loving as humanity, beside her favourite warrior on the <choice>
                                    <corr>plains</corr>
                                    <sic>plalns</sic>
                                </choice> of Troy. But this is but a fabulous hypothesis; for, as we
                                have said, man always loves earthward, and when united to the
                                soulless UndinÃ©, quickly vanishes with her into the ocean of
                                inanity. Here is another cryptic meaning in the mythâthe union is
                                represented as indissoluble. He leaves the human, and descends to
                                her sphereâto a lower state of existence. A man without the
                                influence of love may rise to any height; love is not the absolute
                                requirement for his elevation, as it is for womanâs; but, bound to
                                an inferior nature, he must fall, and does fall invariably,
                                irrecoverably, precisely down to her level. There is no hope for
                                him. He cannot resist the fatal miasma of commonplace. He falls for
                                ever into the dull abyss of mediocrity. We are not proof against any
                                of the daily influences, however trivial, that surround us. Always
                                there is a tendency to assimilation, either by ascension or
                                deterioration, and Tennysonâs proposition is as true in the
                                converse, as in the original statement:â<q>
                                    <l>As the wife is so the husbandâ<emph>he</emph> will sink down
                                        day by day,</l>
                                    <l>What is fine within him growing coarse to sympathise with
                                        clay.</l>
                                </q> And now, as every fable must have a moral, what shall we learn
                                from this mythus of the fatal termination of men who âherd with
                                narrow foreheads?â The moral is obvious. Let all genius remain unwedâ<q>

                            <l>And the echoes of Liberty mingle</l>

                            <l>I had dreams of a future of glory</l>
                            <l rend="ti-1">For this fair motherland of mine,</l>
                            <l>When knowledge would bring with its splendours</l>

                            <l>And as flash follows flash on the mountains,</l>
