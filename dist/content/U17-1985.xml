               FROM: Affirmative Action Committee<lb/>
               DATE: March 27, 1985<lb/>
               SUBJECT: Amendment of the<lb/>
               <hi rend="bold">Code of Academic Ethics</hi>
            </p>
            <p rend="Body text (2)">In the course of reviewing the policy on nepotism, the Faculty
               Council Affirmative Action Committee discussed intimate, personal relationships
               between persons who are not related by blood or marriage and which therefore do not
               fall under the policy on nepotism. The committee found that such relationships
               frequently create difficulties similar to those which the policy on nepotism is
               designed to prevent. To address this problem the Affirmative Action Committee moves
               the amendment of the
               <hi rend="bold" xml:space="preserve">Code of Academic Ethics </hi>as
               indicated in Section A below.</p>
            <p rend="Body text (2)">The committee also discussed intimate, personal relationships
               between faculty and students. The committee felt that such relationships and efforts
               to invite them give rise to complaints of sexual harassment and impair the trust and
               professional integrity which are necessary for an academic community to flourish.
               Accordingly, the Affirmative Action Committee recommends the amendment of the
               <hi rend="bold" xml:space="preserve">Code of Academic Ethics </hi>as
               indicated in Section B below.</p>
