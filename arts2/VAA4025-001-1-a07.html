      <h1><u>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL</u>: Works on Indiana History
      </h1>
      <p id="first">[The following does not aim to be a complete list of works treating of or tributary
         to the history of
         Indiana. Such a bibliography would include a large amount of material of an indirect
         or local
         character that does not come within the scope of the present purpose, which is to
         present a brief
         account of such works as may be of use to the casual student having occasion for inquiry
         along these
         lines. We have also, by way of guidance to the uninformed, indicated what we conceive
         to be the
         respective values of the works considered.]

      <ol>
         <li>
            <p>PRIOR to the work of John B. Dillon, whose <i>Historical Notes</i> was published
               in 1843, there was, practically, no written history of Indiana, either as a State,
               as an
               American Territory, or as a French possession—excepting, of course, the documents
               from which
               the orderly history was subsequently constructed. Dillon entered a virgin field with
               the
               prodigious labor of a pioneer before him, and, single-handed, as it were, worked his
               chosen
               part of this field so industriously and well that he still remains a leading authority
               upon
               the period covered by him. His first book, <i>Historical Notes of the Discovery
                  and Settlement of the Territory Northwest of the </i>, was merged in the <i>History of Indiana</i>, which appeared in 1859. The
               title has been somewhat misleading to many unacquainted with the work, as it is almost
               wholly devoted to the early French occupancy and the Territorial period, the narrative
               proper ending with the admission of the State in 1816. To this is added, however,
               "a general
               view of the progress of public affairs" up to 1856. In the twenty pages devoted to
               this is
               condensed an amount of information that in the hands of a more verbose writer might
               have
               made a small volume. Not the least valuable part of Mr. Dillon's book are the appendices
               of
               Indian treaties and other documents.

         </li>
         <li>
            <p>In our opinion the little volume by J. P. Dunn: <i>Indiana, a Redemption from
                  Slavery</i> (1896), is, next to Dillon's book, the most notable contribution to
               Indiana's historical records. Like Dillon's work it is not a history of the State,
               but is,
               rather, a study of a particular phase of our earlier history—our relations to slavery.
               Incidentally the entire French and Territorial periods are dealt with, and the subject
               throughout added to by original research. Thorough as an investigator, taking full
               advantage
               of the researches of other students, and with a keen and searching 
               <p id="marg"><b>J. P. Dunn</b></p> reasoning faculty, Mr. Dunn reveals the genius of the
               genuine historian, and has the ability, none too common, to write history attractively
               without imperilling his authenticity. His work as a reference book stands the test
               of long
               and frequent usage.

            <p><i>The Conquest of the Country Northwest of the River  and the Life of George Rogers
                  Clark</i>, two large volumes by William H.
               English (1896), is an exhaustive study of one chapter in our earlier history. The
               full scope
               of Mr. English's plan was to write a voluminous history of the State, and this work
               that saw
               the light was but introductory to the larger scheme. Of the particular events with
               which he
               deals the two volumes named are the most thorough study extant, and as such have a
               value
               proportioned to the importance of those events. For years Mr. English was a collector
               of
               rare and valuable material, and a considerable amount of this appears in the "Conquest
               of
               the Northwest."

            <p>An illustrated history of Indiana issued in 1875 under the names of De Witt C. Goodrich and Prof. Charles R.
               Tuttle, and which, in an enlarged form, re-appeared in 1879 sponsored by Wm. S. Haymond,
               was
               then the only book in the field aiming to present the later history of the State,
               and so,
               perhaps, its existence was justified. It is chiefly distinguished by an overburdened
               title-page advertising the phenomenal scope of the work. It has long since been relegated
               to
               the upper shelves where it rests in an oblivion quite comprehensible to any one who
               seeks it
               for historical enlightenment.

            <p>Of the "complete" works, <i>The History of the State of  from the Earliest Explorations by the French to the Present
                  Time</i>, by
               William Henry Smith (1897), is the most ambitious and the fullest. The writer unquestionably
               possesses a wide and varied fund of information; his subject-matter, made more attractive,
               perhaps, by arrangement into numerous topics that fairly well cover the State's story,
               is
               set forth in an easy, readable style, and it will doubtless hold its place as a popular
               history. To the more particular student, who is indisposed and who ought not to be
               asked to
               take things implicitly on faith, the book is less satisfactory. Mr. Smith tells us
               a
               surprising number of new things, but, unfortunately, does not at any time see fit
               to cite
               authorities. The possible suspicion that he prefers a flowing and readable narrative
               to
               strict  accuracy he has taken no pains to avoid, and for
               that reason, if for no other, he will hardly be regarded as a reliable authority

            <p>The <i>Popular History of </i>, a compilation by various authors, but bearing the name of Mrs. T. A.
               Hendricks as sponsor, covers the whole period of our history up to 1891, the date
               of
               publication. It may be regarded as a young peoples' history, and was the first published
               attempt in that line. For a work of its character it was a creditable product, and
               served
               its purpose for a time, but is about forgotten now.

            <p>The <i>Young People's History of </i>, by Mrs. Julia S. Conklin (1899), fills admirably the need it aims to
               subserve. Within the compass of 375 pages it tells the story of the State's development
               in
               the style of one who knows the juvenile mind and has the literary skill to appeal
               to it. The
               work is conscientiously done and, on the whole, is accurate, the few mistakes in it,
               so far
               as we have found, being of minor importance. For use in the school room it is the
               best book
               published so far, and as a convenient reference book it is well worth a place on the
               library
               shelf.

            <p><i>Stories of Indiana</i>, by Maurice Thompson, and <i>Young Folks'
                  Indiana</i>, by W. H. Glascock, are juvenile books designed to awaken in the youthful
               mind an interest in our history. The elements that best lend themselves to attractive
               narrative are chosen, and these are presented with literary ability, making a very
               desirable
               addition to our historical literature.

            <p><i>Biographical and Historical Sketches of Early </i>, by William Wesley Woollen (1883), while chiefly biographical in
               character is yet an important contribution to the history of the State. It deals with
               personages closely identified with the State's life, many of whom, important as were
               their
               services, have no other biographer. Mr. Woollen, personally familiar for many years
               with men
               and affairs in Indiana, devoted long and arduous labor to collecting the material for this book, which
               is, and will always remain the source of information touching many notable Indianians
               whose
               names have all but dropped from public memory.

            <p><i>The Government of the People of the State of </i>, by W. A. Rawles (1897), and <i>The Government of the State
                  of Indiana</i>, by W. W. Thornton, are two small volumes dealing with the civil
               development and the governmental machinery  of the State.
               They are pioneer works in their line, and, if we err not in reading the signs, point
               the way
               to a field where much work of a high quality and important character is going to be
               done. We
               refer to historical work with a distinctively sociological bearing. Such work, indeed,
               is
               already appearing, and there have recently been published two notable theses by college
               men
               which show the trend of historical thought in the universities. The thoroughgoing
               scholar,
               with wide knowledge of historical sources of the subject in hand, and who begrudges
               no pains
               in the attempt to search out and master complex data, is revealed by both these productions,
               and they should certainly take rank among our really valuable historical material.

            <p>The first of these, in date of publication, is <i>The  Trade Route in the Development of the Old Northwest</i>, by Elbert Jay
               Benton, Fellow in History in the Johns Hopkins University, published by that university
               early last year. In substance it is a study of the development of the Wabash valley
               (and
               accompanying influences) through the medium of the Wabash river, the Wabash &amp; Erie canal, and, finally, of the railroads. He traces the effects of
               transportation facilities upon industries and commerce, upon agriculture, upon the
               distribution of population and urban growth. In developing his theme he probes deeper
               into
               the State's great internal improvement experiment than any other writer has yet done,
               and
               when that chapter of our history comes to be adequately treated Mr. Benton's pages
               will be
               of considerable help. Finally, this writer invests his subject not only with interest
               but
               with positive charm; and not the least mission of such literature is to promote the
               taste
               for history in its sociological aspect.

            <p>The <i>Centralizing Tendency in the Administration of Indiana</i>, by Willim A.
               Rawles, Ph. D., Assistant Professor of Economics, Indiana University, was recently
               published
               by the Columbia University as one of a series of history studies that constitute part
               of the
               advanced work of the university. That the study is a serious and ambitious one is
               indicated
               by the length of the thesis, which consists of 322 octavo pages of actual subject
               matter.
               The tendencies traced through the separate histories of a number of governmental activities
               are an integral part of social development, and the data that indicate their true
               sweep are
               many  and complex, but Professor Rawles' investigation of
               these goes far toward proving the thesis he maintains, i. e., that centralization
               is really
               a factor in progress. Aside from his argument and his conclusions his book, purely
               as a
               collection of historical facts, is no small addition to our records. Education, Charities
               and Corrections, the State and public Health, Taxation and the exercise of Police
               powers are
               successively considered in their historical developments, and in each branch of inquiry
               a
               valuable fund of information set forth; while in the generalization and grouping of
               these
               facts to show their direction and sociological significance, the author has doubly
               justified
               his labors. It is hoped that this is but a precursor of much more work of the same
               character.

            <p>In our reference above to the work of college men in Indiana history we overlooked a thesis which antedated the two just noticed by several
               years. This is <i>The State Bank of Indiana</i>, by William F. Harding, published
               by the University of Chicago in The Journal of Political Economy for December, 1895. This paper of 36 octavo
               pages, with an appendix of about equal length, is a careful and instructive study
               of the
               State's financial affairs during the life of the old State Bank, or from 1834 to 1857.
               To
               say that it is a careful study of this important subject is to say that it is a real
               acquisition to our historical literature, and as such is every way worthy to rank
               along with
               the work of Mr. Benton and Mr. Rawles. If published by itself instead of being merely
               a
               feature in a periodical it would, probably, come to the notice of more people and
               be surer
               of a place in the library.

         <li>
            <p><i>The Institutional Influence of the German Element of the Population in , </i>, by Fred J. Bartel, was published within the last year as the second
               paper of the Wayne County Historical Society. This is but a pamphlet of 27 small pages, but is decidedly
               noteworthy as representing a kind of work which, it seems to us, might easily be promoted
               through the higher schools, and which, if so promoted, would certainly result in great
               gain.
               Mr. Bartel has attempted nothing very ambitious or complex—he has simply performed
               a modest
               task well. Studying at first hand the material lying about him, and chiefly, we judge,
               by
               personal interviews, he has taken up one element of the population of his city and
               carefully
               traced its history, its influences and its  character as
               an integral part of the community. Mr. Bartel has done good pioneer work, and when
               the ideas
               of history study now obtaining in our colleges have shifted to another view-point,
               students
               from these institutions will rescue from their respective home localities data which,
               taken
               collectively, will be invaluable.

            <p><i>The  Communities</i>, by George B. Lockwood, while a book devoted to a
               locality, has yet a much wider interest. The romantic story of the New Harmony social experiment with the galaxy of remarkable personages it drew together is
               unique in our annals. Fuller information touching it has long been in demand, and
               Mr.
               Lockwood, after long application, has recently published an extensive study that is
               brimful
               of interest.

            <p>As intimated at the beginning of this list there are many works that touch the history
               of the
               State in one way or another, which hardly come under our present caption. Several
               of these,
               however, in addition to those noticed above, may be casually mentioned. <i>Early
                  Indiana Trials and Sketches</i>, by Oliver H. Smith, U. S. senator and one of the
               State's leading lawyers in the earlier period, is an oft-quoted volume of reminiscences
               which gives many graphic glimpses of the political and legal life of his day, as well
               as pen
               portraits of contemporary notables. <i>Recollections of the Early Settlement of
                  the </i>, by Sanford C. Cox, is another, exceedingly readable, collection of reminiscences
               that
               reach back to the early twenties. <i>The New Purchase</i>, by Baynard R. Hall,
               represents things in and about Bloomington seventy-five years ago. Because of the fictitious and fanciful names given to
               places and persons, which make it largely unintelligible without a key, it is now
               but little
               read, and few, perhaps, know that as a circumstantial and vivid account of the life,
               surroundings and customs of our pioneer population, few other books compare with it.
               <i>Indiana Miscellany</i>, by W. C. Smith, contains considerable interesting
               matter of a reminiscent and anecdotal character. <i>The History of Education in </i>, by Richard G. Boone, is the fullest study of that subject yet published. <i>The Hoosiers</i>, by Meredith Nicholsons, while primarily a literary study, yet deals
               with the historical forces that have made for literature within the State. The <i> Historical Soc. Collection</i>, a number of papers of exceptional value,
               at present is two large volumes with a third in press.
