      <h1>The State Library—Its Character and Aims</h1>B W. E. H, State Librarian
      <p id="first">THE history of the State Library at its beginning and for many years after is a rather
         sorry story of
         a perfunctory institution that existed, not in response to a real demand, but because
         the
         legislature had said it should. It was established in 1825 as a department of the
         office of
         Secretary of State, for the purpose of furnishing information for the officers of
         the State when at
         the capital—or, as the law read: for "the members of the Legislature, the secretaries
         and clerks of
         each House thereof, the officers of the several branches of the executive department
         of the State
         government, the judge of the United States District Court, the United States District
         Attorney, the
         judges of the Supreme Court of this State, and the judges of the Circuit Courts when
         they or, any of
         them may be at the seat of government." Subsequent statutes gradually broadened the
         scope of the
         library and extended its privileges. In 1841 it became a separate institution and
         was removed from
         the Secretary's office.
         <p id="marg"><b>Historical</b></p>
      </p>
      <p>The State Library was for many years a political office. It was understood to belong
         to the party in
         power, and the party majority in the legislature always elected to the office of librarian
         a man of
         the right political faith. It was at once a reward for party service and an earnest
         of party
         support. Men who are put into office for these reasons are not put in for special
         fitness, and
         whatever fitness there might be is largely accidental. The party-chosen State librarians
         were,
         presumably, not an exception to this rule; and the qualifications they possessed stood
         small show of
         useful development, what with uncertain tenure of office and miserly allowance of
         funds.
      </p>
      <p>The latter handicap of itself would have effectually prevented the usefulness of the
         library however
         capable the librarians, and as a matter of fact the library had practically no growth
         for the first
         fifty years of its existence. At the end of that time the collective wisdom had got
         so far away from
         the idea of the library as a political adjunct as to elect women to the office, and
         it should be
         noted that these, so far as can be judged from the evidence at hand, seem to have
         been the first
         incumbents to have the welfare and future of the library at heart. Sarah A. Oren (1873-5),
         appealed
         for a larger  appropriation and affirmed that "the great State of
         Indiana calls loudly for a well-filled reference library." Maggie F. Peelle (1879-'81)
         did a good
         work by starting the collection of books by Indiana writers, and it was by her advice
         that the
         library of the late Daniel Hough was purchased; and equal credit must be given to
         others.
      </p>
      <p>In 1889 Mr. J. P. Dunn became librarian and, through some seemingly miraculous influence,
         succeeded
         in securing a most liberal appropriation. After two years, however, this fund was
         reduced and
         remained wholly inadequate until two years ago, when the people of the State and the
         legislature
         began to see the desirability of more liberal treatment. In consequence, the library
         now has a much
         better outlook than at any time in its past.
      </p>
      <p>In 1895 a law was enacted removing the library from partisan politics, and its management
         was placed
         in the hands of a non-partisan board—the State Board of Education. It was not to be
         managed as part
         of the school system, but was so placed because this board was thought to be as clear
         of partisan
         bias as any body of persons in the State, and at the same time it possessed a special
         degree of
         fitness because the majority of its members were men of the highest educational qualification.
         This
         board represents all parts of the State, and no person on it secures his place by
         virtue of
         political or religious affiliations. It is a board the membership of which can not
         change rapidly,
         and which, through political powers, cannot reward friends or punish enemies. The
         policy of this
         non- partisan and ex officio board has been from the first, and is, that no person
         shall enter the
         service of the library who has not special qualifications for the work.
         <p id="marg"><b>Creating of Non-partisan Library Management</b></p>
      </p>
      <p>The State Library has now a collection of nearly forty thousand volumes consisting
         largely of
         historical material. This is composed of sources rather than secondary matter, being
         made up chiefly
         of State government publications, the publications of the United States government,
         and a very
         considerable collection of local records in the way of town, county and State histories,
         the printed
         archives from various States, and the histories of particular movements, institutions,
         sects and
         specific organizations working toward some specific ends. It should be added that
         the files of
         Indiana newpapers, particularly of the earlier years, are, I believe, fuller and more
         valuable than
         exists elsewhere.
         <p id="marg"><b>Size and Scope of Library</b></p>
      </p>
      <p>State and United States publications are received by deposit and excchange, demanding
         no expenditure
         of money, so that all our purchases are in the lines of history, economics and sociology,
         and, as
         before said, mostly in source material. The library especially seeks those publications
         which are
         either too bulky or too expensive to be owned and preserved by private or small public
         libraries.
         This makes it largely a reference library for historical purposes; yet it is now rapidly
         becoming
         more than is implied in "reference" or "historical." By the provisions of a law enacted
         by the last
         legislature the State Library can now lend any but rare books to any responsible citizen
         of the
         State if the borrower is willing to pay transportation charges. By this plan it is
         enabled to
         supplement the local library and to reach a considerable number who do not have access
         to any local
         library. I hope to see the time when the State at public expense may place the book,
         not merely in
         the post or express office, but in the hands of the reader. Any argument that will
         justify the State
         in buying the book for the reader will equally justify delivering that book to him,
         whether he be
         far or near.
         <p id="marg"><b>State and U. S. Publications, how Acquired</b></p>
         <p id="marg"><b>Method of Circulating Books</b></p>
      </p>
      <p>The State Library makes every possible effort to secure all printed material that
         shall in any way
         throw light upon the history or present condition of Indiana. We purchase, so far
         as possible, every
         book or pamphlet ever written by an Indiana author, upon any subject; or by any author,
         of any time
         or place, upon any subject relating to the State's life.
         <p id="marg"><b>Special Indiana Collection</b></p>
      </p>
      <p>When we have more funds I hope to see this institution become a general reference
         library in all
         departments of science and literature, so that almost any rational demand of the citizens
         of the
         State, within these lines, may be supplied; and I hope to see the State ready to bear
         all expense to
         put the book into the hand of the reader in whatever part of the State he may be.
         A larger fund,
         however, is necessary to these conditions, and in the securing of such fund all citizens
         can have a
         voice. To every citizen a great and really useful institution of this character should
         be a matter
         of interest and pride. By such interest and pride you can materially help the library
         to grow and
         branch out into new fields of usefulness. We bespeak your co-operation.
