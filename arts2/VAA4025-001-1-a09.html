      <p>THE course of history study prescribed for the elementary schools of Indiana, published
         by the
         Department of Public Instruction in the State Manual for 1904-5, should, along with
         the other
         contents of that booklet, be of interest, not only to teachers but to parents. It
         was prepared by a
         committee from the History section of the State Teachers' Association—Prof. Cyrus
         W. Hodgin, Prof.
         S. B. Harding, Prof. N. C. Heironimus, Supt. Adelaide S. Baylor and Supt. George H.
         Tapy. A brief
         outline here of their plan is in place.
      </p>
      <p>The First Year is to be devoted almost wholly to object lessons, to story and to familiar
         things,
         beginning with a study of local surroundings, both social and geographical. Indian
         and pioneer
         relics may be brought to the school room and their interest enhanced by narratives
         of Indian and
         pioneer life. In the study of local geography the pupil's attention is to be guided
         to the fact that
         hills, forests, rivers, etc., offer advantages, and originally induced people to live
         in their
         locality. Food, clothing and ways of living of both the Indians and white men are
         to be studied, and
         the latter part of this year is to be given to stories of notable American pioneers.
      </p>
      <p>The Second Year begins with an introduction to other famous Americans, from George
         Washington to
         Francis Key; then takes up Norse life in story form, and Norse legends and beliefs.
         In this
         transition across the sea foreign children in the school, if there be such, are to
         be utilized in
         bringing out the idea of foreign lands and other peoples. The larger part of the second
         year is to
         be given to this. The Third Year compasses a similar study of Hebrew and Greek life
         and heroes, and
         of the Greek myths. The Fourth Year takes up Rome, and this year the course follows more closely the sequence of events, though still
         by
         the story method. The Fifth Year injects, in a measure, philosophy into the study,
         and deals mainly
         with historical personages as determined by environment and as, in turn, affecting
         events; the
         period being that of the great maratime activity in European history between 1453
         and 1618, the
         French and Revolutionary wars in America, and the middle period of United States history. The Sixth Year is devoted entirely to England. The Seventh and Eighth Years are given to  the United States. For each year a list of books is given to be used as supplementary to the course,
         besides the suggestions as to the utilizing of relics and familiar objects, and the
         whole plan,
         evidently, contemplates emancipation from the time-honored, cut-and-dried text-book
         that has been
         the detestation of many a pupil.
      </p>
      <p>Introductory to the course as thus arranged by the teachers' committee is a disquisition
         setting
         forth a theory of history and stating what should be the view-point and aims of the
         teacher of this
         subject in the elementary schools. "History," it is said, "is the growing life of
         humanity. ∗ ∗ The
         subject of history, then, is the human race and its development, and the purpose of
         teaching it
         should be to lead the child to a broad view of the historic movement, so that he may
         see many ages,
         many civilizations, many stages of the growth, and to be able to compare and contrast
         one with
         another, and thus get a picture of all the struggles and triumphs of men in elevating
         humanity."
         History, it is said, is essentially the history of institutions; the institutions
         of society "do not
         exist for themselves; they are only means to an end. That end is the freedom of man."
         Finally,
         biography is but subsidiary to history, and in teaching it the teacher should bear
         in mind that the
         object is "not that the child may learn about isolated individual men but to see movements
         of
         society through the lives of these men."
      </p>
      <p>Now, the nature and uses of history, its importance in the sum total of one's education,
         from which
         end it shall be approached as a study, the psychology of its acquiring, etc., are
         all mooted
         questions. Eminent scholars have discussed them searchingly. Eminent scholars, like
         doctors, have
         also disagreed, and it follows that any course prescribed must be, in a measure, experimental,
         and
         any theory should be propounded tentatively—certainly not as a finality, even in a
         system of
         positive instruction such as teachers and pupils are supposed to be subjected to.
         Both course and
         theory should expect rigid examination.
      </p>
      <p>What we shall have to say about the present Indiana course will be commendatory rather
         than critical.
         It seems to us to have been the outcome of both thought and experience, and recognizes
         at once the
         difficulties of creating an intelligent attitude toward history and the natural avenues
         to the
         juvenile mind. Its successful application, however, depends much upon a preparation
         more thorough
          than can reasonably be expected of teachers who have to deal
         with a multitude of things, and until the branch has its special teachers as certain
         branches now
         have in the larger centers, the plan of the course will be hampered. The authors of
         this course
         evidently subscribe to the belief that the true educational method in history is from
         the known to
         the unknown, from the familiar to the remote. Just how far this idea is adopted by
         the public school
         systems of the country we do not know, but there has been and is opposition to it.
         The argument, in
         brief, is that the small segment of the near and familiar is so related to antecedents
         that these
         antecedents must be traced before anything like an adequate conception can be had
         of more immediate
         conditions. The State is not comprehensible until led up to by a preparatory knowledge
         of the
         nation; United States history is meaningless unless explained by its forerunners, English and ancient
         history. This argument, like some others that are time-honored, does not seem to be
         conclusive. By
         the same parity of reasoning the antecedent histories insisted upon are meaningless
         unless viewed in
         the light of more remote antecedents, and that involves us in hopelessness, because
         beyond all
         recorded history lies the unrecorded ages where are buried the real roots of things
         that are. The
         truth seems to be that there is no logical starting-point for historical study. The
         utmost we can do
         is to fix upon a unit (whether it be a single State or all the records of the nations)
         that, in a
         manner, stands complete and which, within limits, explains its own nature, as all
         things do by the
         syntheses they present. We may choose an immensely large and complex unit, and feel
         our way, very
         much in the dark and but dimly knowing what we are after, from the outer margin inward,
         or we may
         take a unit that comes somewhat within the comprehension, and which has the very important
         advantage
         of engaging the interest at the start, and, as the conception of it enlarges by study,
         reach out
         farther and farther into the great sphere of causes and relations, with the lamp of
         ever increasing
         enlightenment guiding the way. To us it seems that the latter is by far the more hopeful
         method. We
         venture the belief that in a long and completed course the pupil by this method will
         gain quite as
         broad a comprehension of history and its meanings as by the attempt to lay the broad
         foundation at
         the start; while in the many instances where but limited time is given to the subject,
         he will, in
         the first instance, be enlightened  just so far as he goes, while
         in the other case he will, perhaps, have gained but a fragment of a "foundation,"
         which will be of
         as much use as foundations usually are without a super-structure. However, this is
         but our theory,
         and maybe we are quite wrong.
      </p>
      <p>With the theory of history above quoted from the Manual we disagree, and we dissent
         the more
         decidedly because it is presented, not as a discussable opinion, but as authoritative
         statement from
         which, supposedly, teachers are to take their view-point and to teach accordingly.
         A theory which
         aims to have so wide an influence as this, and which is helped on its way by authority,
         aside from
         its intrinsic merit, certainly ought to stand close scrutiny. We do not think that
         this one does. In
         its definitions of history and the aims of historical study much, it seems to us,
         is left out of the
         survey. History is not alone the "growing life of humanity;" it is everything of importance
         that has
         ever been recorded in the experience of man; and the aim of its study is not alone
         to appreciate the
         grand spectacle of historic movements but to learn whatever of importance has happened
         within the
         experience of man. Among those happenings has been decadence as well as growth—the
         power within
         ourselves that made for wrong as well as the power not ourselves that makes for righteousness,
         and
         to take cognizance of the diseases engendered by man in the body politic is, it may
         be held, of
         quite as much importance as contemplating the more pleasing manifestations. To interpret
         history
         wholly in terms of grand progressive laws, however desirable an exercise that may
         seem to be for the
         school room, reminds one of Emerson's Providence dressed up "in a clean shirt and white neckcloth," whereas Providence in history has, to quote the sage again, "a wild, rough, incalculable road to its
         end,"
         and sometimes is far from lovely. The contemplation of the historic processes is something
         other
         than cultural in the literary or esthetic sense. The very center of interest, we take
         it, is the
         place of man as a determining agent, and particularly as a corrective force in the
         great march of
         events. To ignore this is much as if a physician should make a study of anatomy and
         physiological
         functions in their ideal forms and pay no attention to the science of conserving and
         restoring
         health. The decline and fall of the Roman Empire and the causes thereof have in them
         lessons  among the most important of all history, and on the theory that
         man is a determining factor in his own fortunes it surely behooves him to know such
         lessons well.
      </p>
      <p>Again, history is but the history of institutions, says the Manual in substance. Institutions
         "do not
         exist for themselves; they are only means to an end. That end is the freedom of man."
         Hence the
         study of history is a study of the freeing of man. That, we fear, is more transcental
         than true—it
         sounds better than it is. To say that an institution is but a means to an end (impliedly
         an
         extraneous means) is analagous to the assumption, so frequently made, that work is
         but a means to an
         end—which is, the enjoyment of the fruits of work. And yet those who have no work
         but have a
         super-abundance of the fruits of work, as the idle rich, are among the most discontented
         of people.
         We would submit as a truer proposition that work, performance, the bringing to pass,
         the creating of
         new forms, is for its own sake a requirement of human existence, and that institutions,
         which are
         necessary forms taken by work, represent a natural activity so incorporated with man's
         welfare that
         to say they are merely means, or in any sense extraneous, is meaningless. Then as
         to man's
         freedom—to what extent is that true? The mastery of man, collectively, over nature—"freeing
         himself
         from the limitations of time and space," as it is put, is but a small are in the full
         circle of
         freedom. With increasing obligations that come with advancing civilization the individual
         is shorn
         of much of the freedom that goes with the more primitive life—the rights of others
         necessarily
         become more binding. If, on the one hand, there is an advance toward political freedom,
         on the other
         there is a corresponding movement not only toward social restrictions but in the direction
         of
         industrial slavery. Out of the power of capital issue systems wherein the bread-earner,
         as never
         before, is held like a beast in a tread-mill. Out of the power of labor organizations
         issue demands,
         as never before, that seem to strike at the very roots of our ideas of freedom. In
         the face of all
         this, to say that the study of history is a study of the freeing of man is somewhat
         incomprehensible.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, exception may be taken to the Manual's theory of biography and the assertion
         that the great
         personage is chiefly of interest as he is the center of a historical movement and
         an instrument  to elucidate that movement by. If there are streams or
         aggregates of force there are also units of force, and it is quite permissible to
         hold that to the
         unit for its own sake attaches a very keen interest. Where man is the unit this is
         particularly
         true, for personality and its mysteries—the possibility of the individual, always
         has been and
         always will be, in its own right, of supreme human interest. This fact remains true
         however much the
         individual is carried along by the general stream, and in our daily life, wherever
         we come into
         touch with a really strong personality, we realize it. Had Washington or Lincoln been
         stricken out
         of their respective periods the movements in which they have figured would have gone
         on—history
         would still have been made, but it would have been changed more than we can realize.
         In studying
         these men biographically the influences they exerted, the qualities they revealed,
         the native power
         residing within them that welled up under the stress of circumstances, is the very
         center of
         interest, and the attempt to transfer that interest to something, however large, outside
         of them,
         is, it seems to us, to wholly misapprehend the real character of biography as distinguished
         from
         history proper. It is Carlyle, we believe, who somewhere speaks of man as "the most
         interesting
         little fellow on the planet," and Carlyle is not yet quite out of court, though some
         of us at the
         present day like to lose ourselves in the immensity of the universal.
