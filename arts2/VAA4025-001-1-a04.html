      <h1>Gleaned from the Pioneers</h1>
      <p id="first">[Under this heading we will aim to present, from issue to issue, reminiscences gathered
         at first-hand
         from surviving pioneers, and written in a popular vein. While the Indian story, immediately
         below,
         does not fell precisely within this scope, it seems as good a place as any to insert
         it.—<i>Ed.</i>]

      <p>A I S</p>
      <p>ALONG the Wabash and Mississinewa rivers, in northern Indiana, where the red man and his traditional lore are not yet quite forgotten, there lingers
         many a fugitive story which has never found the publicity of print. Those who know
         them are yearly
         becoming scarcer, but an industrious collector might still glean an interesting harvest.
         Here is a
         sample which we have picked up from Gabriel Godfrey, a son of Francis Godfroy, who
         was the last war
         chief of the Miami Indians. Gabriel Godfroy, the most notable Indian now to be found
         in Indiana, lives a few miles east of the city of Peru, on a small remnant of the ample lands once reserved to his father.<sup>∗</sup> With the true primitive instinct he treasures the unwritten history of his people
         as it has
         been handed down from site to son, and this story, told in a quaint style that must
         be largely lost
         in the writing, is only one of many. The narrative is gruesome, but reflects the Indian
         life and
         spirit, and has the ethnic value—the value of the folk-story.
      </p>
      <p>Once a young Miami brave took to wife a daughter of the Wea tribe, further down the
         Wabash, and because of her left his own people to go and live among the strangers. While
         the
         Miami was still a stranger a marauding band of Kickapoos caught and scalped a Wea
         woman, and the cry
         arose for vengeance. A council was held, and when the braves sat in circle the head
         man of the
         village passed around with a war club, offering it to each in turn. If one took the
         club it
         signified that he accepted the leadership of a war party to pursue the enemy: but
         that not only
         meant danger—it: also meant disgrace to the leader if the expedition failed. One by
         one the braves
         let the club pass. Ere it reached the Miami he thought much. To accept it was to risk
         much, but to
         let it pass was to show fear, and he had his reputation to establish among his new
         friends; so when
         it came to him he took it and became chief of the war party, pledged to avenge the
         wrongs done his
         people.
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li><sup>∗</sup>Since writing the above we understand that Gabriel has lost even this
            remnant.
         </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Then the armed braves started out on the trail. Ere long they came to the rude picture
         of a buck cut
         on the bark of a tree. This was the totem sign of the leader of their foes, and the
         carving was an
         act of bravado. When they saw the sign the Weas paused and spoke discouragingly to
         each other. They
         knew the Buck. His boldness and his craft were notorious, and often before they had
         sought vengeance
         for his deeds, but to no avail. To pursue him now was of no use, they said, and they
         would have
         turned back; but their Miami leader said no—they must follow and pit cunning against
         cunning. So
         they followed for many miles, the trail growing hotter, till at length they came in
         sight of their
         enemies' smoke. Then they went warily as wild beasts creeping upon their prey, and
         when they had
         drawn near two of them, disguised as wolves, crept closer yet and found the Kickapoos
         lolling beside
         their fire, the leader being distinguished by a buck tattooed upon his thigh. When
         the two Weas
         returned to their companions a council was held. They outnumbered their foes, and
         it was decided
         that the party should creep up and, if possible, kill all but the Buck—him they would
         take alive and
         be revenged for all the trouble he had caused them. They managed well, and the Kickapoos
         were shot
         down before they could offer fight, but when they came to lay hands upon the Buck
         he was so strong
         that he threw them aside like children till one Wea, older and more experienced than
         the others,
         struck him across the muscles of his arms with a war-club, when his hands fell powerless.
         So they
         took and bound him. When the Buck saw that no further resistance could avail he bade
         his captors
         burn him then and there and save themselves trouble, for he would not go with them
         to be sport for
         their village. This was not what they wished, for their greatest glory would be to
         return to their
         people leading their prisoner in triumph to be sacrificed before them all. No cruel
         forcing that
         they could devise, however, would make him go. He taunted them, defying them to burn
         him there,
         until at length they bound him to a tree and piled the fagots about him. When the
         fire began to burn
         he asked for a pipe to smoke. It was given him, and as the flames licked about his
         flesh he caimly
         smoked until, the life slowly driven out the pipe dropped from his mouth and he hung
         limp in his
         bonds. So he frustrated his enemies at the last, but they returned in triumph, having
         ridded
         themselves of the Buck, and the young Miami had won glory for himself.
      </p>
      <p>But glory, among the red men as among the white, is sometimes harder to maintain than
         it is to gain.
         In course of time another hostile band committed depredation upon the Weas, and again
         the Miami, who
         had succeeded so well before, led a party in pursuit. The trail they followed led
         across a little
         swampy place, and from the end of a log the fugitives had passed over the soft ground,
         each leaping
         in the tracks of the first one. When the leader of the Weas came to the end of the
         log he too leapt
         into the first foot-print made by their enemies, and he found himself out-witted by
         their cunning;
         for in this first track they had skilfully sunken an arrow with the barb pointing
         upward and
         concealed just beneath the surface. On this he came with all his weight and ran his
         foot through and
         through, so that his party had to carry him back home humiliated with failure.

      <p>ONE of the sprightliest "recollectionists" in Indianapolis is the venerable John W. Ray, Hoosier octogenarian, who during his long life has
         been
         in the thick of things, and whose memory is good. Some sixty years ago Mr. Ray entered
         the walls of
         DePauw College, or, as it was then called, Asbury University, to equip himself for
         the battle of
         life, and what he has to say about it will perhaps be of interest to DePauw folks,
         and some others
         as well.
      </p>
      <p>"In those days," says Mr. Ray, "the boy who had his way paid and his path made easy
         and pleasant was
         the exception. The large proportion of them were of the pioneer type—poor boys, many
         of them from
         the farm, who had to live at the minimum cost and work at a maximum pressure. Their
         clothes were
         generally home spun, and fashioned by the loving hands of self-sacrificing mothers.
         Under-clothes
         were regarded as effeminate, and were rarely worn, and such superfluities of toilet
         as are now worn
         for the sake of adornment were but little in evidence.
      </p>
      <p>"When I went there, in the early '40s three of us rented a room for two dollars per
         month that was
         sumptuously furnished with a stove and two or three chairs, an old bedstead and a
         straw tick, which
         latter we were privileged to replenish at the straw-pile when we wished. Here we cooked,
         ate,
         studied and slept. Our board  bills averaged about one dollar per
         week, and the fare gave us abundant strength to fight our way through Greek, Latin,
         mathematics and
         the applied sciences.
      </p>
      <p>When James Harlan from Parke County came there with his worldly effects done up in a beggarly bundle no one seemed willing
         to trust him for his board, so he went to the president and offered to do janitor
         work in the
         college for the use of a vacant room in the building. The room was granted him and
         he managed to
         live there and board himself, and in the end was one of those who have honored old
         Asbury. When he
         graduated he had not even a coat to don, and in lieu thereof wore a calico dressing
         gown
         supplemented by a pair of old slippers on his feet. About that time the Iowa University was established, and soon after a committee from that State came to Asbury
         in search of a good man for their president. Harlan was recommended to them; he was
         sent for, and
         within thirty days after his graduation in the dressing-gown he was installed as the
         new president
         of the new college. He became a prominent citizen of his adopted State. In the winter
         of '45-'46 the Iowa legislature established a Department of Public Instruction, and Harlan, although
         he was
         a Whig and the legislature was Democratic, was chosen as superintendent. Subsequently
         he was honored
         with other offices, among them that of the U. S. senatorship. He was Secretary of
         the Interior in
         President Lincoln's cabinet, and also judge in the Court of Claims. James Harlan was
         a cousin of
         Judge Harlan, of the Supreme Court Bench. He was the best debater, the best logician
         and the best
         judge of men I ever knew. He never wrote his speeches, but filled himself full of
         his subject and
         out of that fulness spoke with eloquence and spontaneity.
      </p>
      <p>"And by the way, do you know that Indiana has furnished more citizens and more Methodists
         to Iowa than to any other State in the west?
      </p>
      <p>"One of the brightest students of old Asbury, and one who, I feel sure, would have
         made his mark had
         he been spared, bore the odd name of Greenberry Short. Short came as a homeless wanderer
         to the
         office of Judge Samuel Hough, of Lafayette, and solicited a job as office boy. Hough employed him, and before long noticed that
         the lad spent all his leisure time dipping into the law books. Becoming interested
         in him he
         encouraged him to enter Asbury, rendering him such assistance as lay in his power.
         While  there he made his way by doing janitor service and such work as offered
         itself. He carried off the honors of his class, and after graduation returned to study
         law in Judge
         Hough's office. But the confinement proved fatal to him. He fell a victim to hasty
         consumption and
         was cut off in the flower of his promise. I remember that we celebrated, or attempted
         to celebrate,
         Greenberry's twenty-first birth day in a way all our own. His face was peculiarly
         soft and smooth,
         and taking our cue from that, we seized him and bore him in triumph to a private room
         where one of
         the boys was ready with a big basin and soap, a painter's brush and a huge pruning
         knife. His face
         and head was plentifully lathered preparatory to his maiden shave, but before the
         pruning knife
         could be applied the victim made a break for liberty and eescaped down street, lather
         and all.
      </p>
      <p>"Daniel W. Voorhees was in the class just before mine. Voorhees was good in belle
         lettres, rhetoric
         and history, but in mathematics, logic, languages, or in fact anything that took hard
         work, he fell
         short. He was no such man as Harlan. Voorhees' acquirements were on the surface, Harlans'
         in the
         depths.
      </p>
      <p>"I may add that in those days there was no football, no baseball and no college yells.
         Boys who were
         hungry enough for knowledge to work their way to it by hands as well as by brains
         had less need of
         those gentle diversions. We did, however, play townball and cricket somewhat. We were
         also sturdy
         ramblers, and as to our gymnasium it was, practically, all of Putnam County."

      <p>ONE of the "walking encyclopedias" of information touching things historic is "Uncle
         Joe" Brown, who,
         although bent with the weight of many years and patiently expectant of the Summons,
         still holds his
         desk in the County Clerk's office, at Indianapolis, where he does diligent daily service in the rounding out of a busy life. A
         well-directed question suffices to start Uncle Joe, and he will reel you off a medley
         which turns
         this way or that as one theme suggests another.
      </p>
      <p>We were nosing among the old records of the Marion County Commissioners' office, and finding sundry allusions to the office of "fence viewer"
         we
         went to Mr. Brown to learn what a fence-viewer might be. He told us all about it.
         In early days, it
         seems, when there were large unclaimed tracts and much stock had the range of the
         country, there was
         considerable trouble with animals breaking into growing crops, what with breachy "critters"
         and poor
         fences. This caused no end of wrangling—so much so, indeed, that a law was passed
         defining a "legal
         fence," or one that in law should be considered a sufficient guard. Along with this
         went a
         functionary whose business it was to judge whether a man's fence was up to the legal
         standard when
         his neighbor's hungry hordes visited his succulent corn. This was the "fence-viewer."
         As the country
         came to have less waste land and the liberties of the omnivorous cow and elm-peeler
         were restricted
         the services of the viewer fell into desuetude and he passed into forgotten history.
         In importance
         and dignity the office ranked along with that of road supervisor.
      </p>
      <p>Something in this reminded Uncle Joe of a story of ex-President Tyler. After John
         Tyler retired from
         the presidential office his neighbors of the other party, as a sort of a practical
         joke, and also,
         perhaps, to show their opinion of his capacity, got together and elected him road-master;
         but they
         wote not they were casting a boomerang. John accepted the office. The Virginia law gave this functionary almost unlimited power in calling out citizens for road
         service, and the distinguished road-master made the most of his privileges. For about
         three months
         that year, in season and out of season, he worked his constituency on the public highways
         till they
         wished they hadn't done it. Tyler stood the "joke" better than they did, and the traveling
         public
         got the benefit.
      </p>
      <p>"Did you know," queried Mr. Brown, "that Jefferson, Madison and Monroe were all justices
         of the peace
         after serving as President of the United States?. They were, and they thought the humbler office worthy of them—which shows a more
         democratic spirit than we find to-day. Besides, Jefferson and Monroe left the presidential
         chair
         poor, and the justice's fees were not to be sneezed at in those simple days. I don't
         know about
         Madison's circumstances—probably Dolly looked after them with her characteristic vim.
      </p>
      <p>"I remember Dolly Madison. When I was a clerk in the United States Senate she used
         frequently to
         visit that body and sit as a  guest of honor beside the
         Vice-president. They were wont to show her every mark of respect. Whenever she appeared
         business
         would be suspended for the moment and she would be gallantly escorted to her seat,
         usually by the
         venerable John Quincy Adams. She was a fat old woman of seventy then, and he eighty-eight,
         and as
         they marched up the aisle with stately gravity they were a pair to be remembered.
      </p>
      <p>John Quincy Adams—ah, there was a Nestor for you! He has been frequently spoken of
         as ‘the Old Man
         Eloquent,’ but that does not fitly characterize him. He had a squeaky voice, was not
         prepossessing
         as a speaker, and his power lay not so much in oratory as in learning. He seemed to
         have read
         everything, ancient and modern, and to have remembered everything. No one ever asked
         him about
         anything but he could make it the theme for an off-hand dissertation full of erudition.
         Withal, he
         knew how to use his learning with trip-hammer effect. On one occasion Henry A. Wise,
         of Virginia, eloquently and scathingly arraigned the abolitionists for the mischief they were
         somenting. Wise was a genuine orator, and when he was done the abolitionists and their
         cause looked
         a sorry spectacle. Then Adams arose to reply, and he took an hour at the task. At
         the end of that
         hour Wise was simply annihilated, and his argument, from first to last, torn to tatters.
         Mere
         oratory and super-heated feeling stood no show at all against countless facts and
         sound logic. Wise
         himself, in response, said, with as much grace as possible, that Mr. Adams might advocate
         any
         proposition whatsoever and he, for one, would not again venture to enter the lists
         against him. I
         remember one little thing that illustrated Adams' Yankee caution. It was the custom
         of the Senate
         pages to secure autographs of the notables, which, no doubt, they disposed of to their
         own profit. I
         noticed repeatedly that Mr. Adams, when he honored these requests, had a habit of
         signing his name
         at the top of the sheet or slip, leaving very little margin above. Curious to know
         why he did this I
         once asked him about it, and in reply he squeaked: ‘I do that so no one can write
         a note over my
         name.’ I was sitting near Mr. Adams and was one of those who carried him out of the
         Senate chamber
         when he was stricken down. He collapsed in his seat as if shot, but rallied enough
         to gasp: ‘And
         this is the last of earth!’ And so passed a great man.
      </p>
      <p>"What other famous men have I known? More than I could talk about or think of in one
         sitting, young
         man; and witnessed more changes than most men of the present generation. I suppose
         I am the only one
         now living who was present when the first public trial was made of the magnetic telegraph.
         A
         dispatch was to be sent from Washington to Baltimore, and the members of Congress and others were invited to witness the test. Professor
         Morse had been the guest of Henry L. Ellsworth, Commissioner of Patents, and in courtesy
         he had
         invited Mr. Ellsworth's daughter, Anna, to write the first message. She arrived a
         little late, and
         stepping at once to an old desk that stood in a corner wrote this, from the twenty-first
         chapter of
         Numbers: ‘What God hath wrought.’ Morse transmitted this over the wire, and in about
         five minutes
         the answer came back, and thus a new factor was introduced into civilization."
      </p>
      <p>We had heard it stated that Mr. Brown had written the first review of a Hoosier book
         ever written by
         a Hoosier, and we asked him about it. "That," he said, "was the Indian poem, ‘Elskatawa,’
         by George
         W. Cutter, better known to fame by his ‘Song of Steam.’ I don't remember much about
         the review now,
         but one incident in connection with Cutter I have reason for remembering very vividly.
         Cutter fell
         in love with a Mrs. Drake, an actress, here in Indianapolis, and, as became a poet, his falling was as deep as it was sudden. He wanted her to
         marry, but the lady said nay. She seems to have been persuaded at the last minute,
         however, and just
         as she was on the eve of a nocturnal flight to make connection with another engagement.
         At any rate
         it was a midnight marriage, fully up to the standard of the romancist. At that time
         I happened to be
         the clerk of whom people who wanted to amalgamate had to get their license, and at
         an hour of the
         night so late that the very clocks had stopped running and gone to rest I was knocked
         out of bed and
         haled across town through the grewsome darkness to the court house to issue the required
         document.
         That is why I have a particularly lively recollection of George W. Cutter.
      </p>
      <p>"Well, well, I must get to work! Yes, young man, the fence-viewer is an institution
         of the good old
         times—you will never see his like again." And Uncle Joe turned once more to his unfinished
         page of
         scribing.
