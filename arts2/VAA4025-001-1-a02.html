      <h1>John Brown Dillon</h1>
      <h1>The Father of Indiana History</h1>
      <p id="first">IT is eminently fitting that we should begin this magazine with a sketch of the man
         who not only
         ranks as Indiana's first and best historian, but whose ideals, methods, character
         and accomplishment
         we deem worthy to keep continually in mind as a model to follow in historical work.
      </p>
      <p>John B. Dillon may fairly be called "the father of Indiana history," for he was the
         first to enter
         that field with any seriousness of purpose, and his contributions exceed in value
         any that have come
         after. His real merit is best appreciated by those who seek historic truth and accuracy—who
         want
         facts authenticated by the evidences of thorough, conscientious research, and who
         like the same told
         in simple, direct language, with no sacrifices for the sake of a popular style. The
         sense of his
         perfect honesty and trustworthiness continually grows upon one that has occasion to
         use him much,
         and the student of the period and locality with which he deals inevitably comes to
         use him as the
         most satisfactory authority. No higher compliment than this can be paid to a historian.
         Bancroft,
         Parkman, Prescott, Motley were not more devoted to their chosen course than Dillon,
         nor brought to
         their tasks riper qualifications, and had he wrought in the broader field his name
         might have ranked
         with theirs in the world's estimation. He had certain noble ideas, severe and simple,
         as to the
         office of the historian, and no artist was truer to his art than he to this ideal.
         They were not
         ideas that catered in any sense to that popular taste that demands the picturesque
         whatever may be
         the fate of truth. It is quite safe to say that he would not, if he had been able,
         have heralded his
         works with a blast of trumpets; and that, perhaps, is why even his own friends, as
         has been
         affirmed, did not read his books and why he died in poverty.
      </p>
      <p>Mr. Dillon, as a man, was modest to shyness, and so little disposed to talk about
         himself, even to
         his nearest friends, that something like a mystery seems to hang over his life. According
         to the
         best authority he was born at Wellsburg, West Virginia, in the year 1808. He learned the printer's trade when a lad, and drifted to Cincinnati, where he remained ten years, working at the case. During this period he brought
         himself into notice as a poet by verses contributed to  Flint's
         Western Review, the Western Souvenir, the Cincinnati Gazette and other western periodicals; but this disposition evidently wore off with
         his
         youth. A few of these poems, among them "The Burial of the Beautiful," have been preserved
         in
         Coggeshall's collection of western poets. In 1834 he migrated to Logansport, Ind. Here he studied law and was admitted to the bar, but law was not to his taste, and
         he
         never practiced.
         <p id="marg"><b>Birth, Early Life and Work</b></p>
      </p>
      <p>About this time he seems to have taken up with his historical studies and to be laying
         plans for his
         future "History of Indiana." His first work was issued in 1843 and was called "Historical Notes of the Discovery
         and Settlement of the Territory Northwest of the Ohio." This was introductory to and contained much of the material for a riper and more
         ambitious volume which, in 1859, appeared under the title of "A History of Indiana," from its earliest exploration to the close of the Territorial government in 1816;
         to
         which was added a general view of the progress of public affairs in the State from
         1816 to 1856. It
         is this work on which Dillon's fame chiefly rests. The fruit of the next twenty years
         was a small
         volume entitled "Notes on Historical Evidence in Reference to Adverse Theories of
         the Origin and
         Nature of the Government of the United States," and a thick 8-vo. on the "Oddities
         of Colonial
         Legislation." These four volumes, together with a few addresses<sup>∗</sup> and a little
         miscellaneous writing, represent more than forty years of research.
      </p>
      <p>Few historians escape the charge of occasional mistakes, and Mr. Dillon, doubtless,
         was not an
         exception to the rule; but, as we have before said, a sense of his trustworthiness
         grows upon the
         student, and the seeker after authentic information learns to regard him as the most
         satisfactory
         authority on early Indiana affairs. It is not easy to define the quality that begets
         confidence in a
         historian—it is, indeed, somewhat akin to the mystery of personality. Suffice to say
         in this
         connection that Dillon's work throughout bears the internal evidence of immense industry,
         unflagging
         perseverance and an ever-present purpose to find and state the truth. Of his industry
         and its
         breadth of scope, too, we have other evidence. In the preface to his "Historical Notes"
         he refers to
         "many official documents, <sup>∗ ∗ ∗</sup> a very great number of printed authorities, and
         many thousand pages of old manuscript records and letters;" and 
         <ol>
            <li><sup>∗</sup>One of these addresses. "The National Decline of the Miami Indians,"
               was delivered before the Indiana Historical Society in 1848, and is published in its
               collection.
            </li>
         </ol> in the preface to his History he speaks of "historical researches
         which for a period of about twenty years have been perseveringly extended over a very
         large field,"
         and adds this paragraph: 
         <p>"For the privilege of examining valuable and interesting private collections of manuscripts
            and other documents relating to the early civil and military affairs of Indiana, my public thanks are due to Hon. John Scott Harrison, of Ohio; Hon. William G. Armstrong, of Clark County, Indiana; the family of Capt. Robert Buntin, of Indiana; Elihu Stout, esq., of Knox county, Indiana; the family of Gen. Hyacinth Lasselle, of Indiana; and the family of Gen. John Tipton, of Indiana. For the use of various important manuscripts and other valuable documents, and
            for many interesting verbal statements concerning the public affairs of Indiana, my
            acknowledgements have been tendered to General Marston G. Clark, Major Ambrose Whitlock,
            Mr.

            Wm. J. Brown, Col-Williamt Reyburn, and many other gentlemen who have, at different
            periods,
            manifested a friendly interest in the progress of my historical researches in the
            west. In
            the course of an examination of various old French manuscripts relating to the early
            affairs
            of the country lying northwest of the river Ohio, I have, at different times, received essential assistance from Rev. A. M. A.
            Martin, Dr. Luke Munsell, James W. Ryland, esq., and Col. John B. Duret."
         </p>
      </p>
      <p>To one familiar with the names of early Indiana notables this quotation is of interest as showing that Dillon was widely in touch
         with
         the men who were active in the history of the young common-wealth, and it appears
         that he diligently
         improved his opportunities. In this respect he had the advantage over all historians
         of a later day,
         for not only did there exist for him, as the pioneer, the wealth of a virgin field,
         but the
         venerable men then nearing their ends intimately knew the beginnings of the Territory
         and State.<sup>∗</sup> Even 
         <ol>
            <li><sup>∗</sup>In the preface to the Historical Notes he says: "A list of the persons
               from whom I have received rare and valuable manuscripts, and aid and encouragement
               in the
               midst of perplexing difficulties, shall be published in the form of an appendix at
               the close
               of the second volume of this work." In his subsequent History no such appendix exists,
               and
               the paragraph above quoted evidently takes its place. In the preface of the first
               book he
               mentions Rev. Mr. Martin, of Vincennes; J. W. Ryland, Esq., of Cincinnati; J. B. Duret, Esq., of Logansport, and Dr. Munsell, of Indianapolis, as having rendered assistance in the examination and translation of French
               documents. In this preface, also, he gives an extended list of works consulted.
            </li>
         </ol> the mass of the "manuscript records and letters" alluded to,
         which might have been preserved for future students, seems to have passed away, and
         in view of this
         loss we are doubly indebted to Dillon, who ferreted them out and made such good use
         of them. General
         John Coburn's sketch of Dillon,<sup>∗</sup> which is the best published source of
         information, states that when the latter was secretary of the State Historical Society
         he prepared
         and issued many circulars to people in various counties asking questions bearing upon
         all the
         prominent facts in the history of different important localities. Answers were received
         and filed
         away, and a large amount of data preserved for future use, but this, Mr. Coburn tells
         us, "has been
         stolen or destroyed; no trace of it remains." According to this writer Dillon had
         supervision of the
         historical material contained in the large State and county atlas of Indiana, published
         by Baskin,
         Forster &amp; Co., in 1876.
      </p>
      <p>Mr. Dillon manifestly lacked either the disposition or the tact to adapt himself to
         the work that
         promised most. The writing of the "History of Indiana Territory" would easily and
         naturally, one
         would think, open the way to a history of the State, especially as that field was
         entirely new
         ground. If he had so directed his energies he would, doubtless, have supplied a real
         and much-felt
         need far more adequately than any who have since attempted it. Of the two volumes
         he produced
         instead, the "Notes on Historical Evidence," and "Oddities of Colonial Legislation,"
         it might be
         said that he could hardly have chosen subjects less inviting to the popular taste.
         On the other hand
         they are conceded to have a distinctive value. The first-mentioned is searching and
         fundamental in
         its aim, and touches the origin and nature of the United States government, and the
         relations of
         State to Federal authority. Concerning the "Oddities" it will suffice to again draw
         upon Mr. Coburn,
         who describes it as a work "so full of information and so unique in character, bearing
         such
         indubitable evidences of authenticated and conscientious research that it is without
         a parallel in
         American literature, and will be the perpetual text-book upon this subject. Here may
         be found rare
         specimens of the vain, ridiculous and laughable efforts of the legislators to patch
         up the ills of
         society, as quack doctor's medicines are invented, put on the market and rejected."

         </ol> was his last work, being, indeed, unfinished at the time of his
         death. It would seem that he found a purchaser for his manuscript before its completion,
         for it is
         said that he received for it some three hundred dollars—and this was his pecuniary
         return for years
         of labor!
      </p>
      <p>Mr. Dillon was one of the many in the world's history who have not prospered according
         to their
         deserts. He clove to his work with that unflagging passion which should distinguish
         the true worker
         in the exercise of his natural talent, but his books brought him little remuneration.
         Unworldly,
         simple-minded and idealistic, with little regard for self, he was illy qualified to
         contend for the
         world's rewards. A few stanch friends, who were drawn to him by his ability and worth
         and beauty of
         character, exercised over him a sort of paternal care, and through their efforts he
         was appointed to
         various public offices which for thirty years afforded him a living. From 1845 to
         1851 he was State
         Librarian, then assistant Secretary of State and Secretary of the Board of Agriculture,
         and after
         that an appointee to a clerkship in the Department of the Interior at Washington City, where he lived twelve years. The last four years of his life he spent in Indianapolis, poor almost to the verge of want, his friends afterward suspected, although, with
         characteristic reserve, he kept that fact to himself. There are many who remember
         the retired,
         gentle old man with the never-absent side-glasses concealing his eyes. Being unmarried
         and entirely
         alone as regarded blood ties, he occupied a poorly-furnished room by himself in the
         top of the old
         Johnson block, where the State Life building now stands. Here he died on the 27th
         of February, 1879.
         Not until his effects were examined was it known that he was so poor. His very books
         had gone one by
         one to the second-hand store, like household treasures to the pawn-shop, and his friends
         agree in
         believing that the fear of want hastened his end.
      </p>
      <p>Forty years of honest, conscientious devotion; four books that people would not buy,
         and death in a
         lonely garret face to face with grim poverty because he wrought for the love of truth
         and not for
         dollars—this is the life-story of John B. Dillon. He is buried in Crown Hill, just
         west of the
         soldiers' graves, and the friends who were kind to him in life have erected a fitting
         monument to
         his memory. That he lies beside the heroic dead is well, for he, too, gave his life
         to a cause and
         did his country a service.
