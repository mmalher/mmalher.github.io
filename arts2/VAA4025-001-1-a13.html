      <p id="first">The Games of Moccasin and Bullet</p>
      <p>The following, written by the late Robert B. Duncan, a well-known pioneer of Marion County, throws further light on the game of "mockuson" spoken of by Tipton (see journal,
         p.
         15).
      </p>
      <p>"Bullet, as it was termed, was a gambling game considerably used in its day; so much
         so as to cause
         the enactment [of a law] making it a finable offense to play it. It was borrowed from
         the 
         <ol>
            <li><sup>∗</sup>"On the 26th of August, 1789, about two hundred mounted volunteers,
               under the command of Colonel John Hardin, marched from the Falls of the Ohio to attack some of the Indian towns on the Wabash. This expedition returned to the Falls on the 26th of September, without the
               loss of a man—having killed six Indians, plundered and burnt one deserted village,
               and
               destroyed a considerable quantity of corn."—Dillon, p. 220.
            </li>
            <li>†Since the above was put in type the editor finds the question of this Indian town
               discussed at length by D. D. Banta, in the larger history of Johnson County, pp. 283-286. Judge Banta's conclusion would seem to be in line with Mr.
               Dollarhide's version. For further information touching the white captive of the upper
               town
               see <i>The Western Censor</i> (Indianapolis public library), June 11, 1823.
            </li>
         </ol>Delaware Indians,<sup>∗</sup> who were great experts in playing it, and were inveterate
         gamblers. I well recollect frequently seeing them playing the game, which was then
         called
         "moccasin," and was played in this wise:
      </p>
      <p>"The professional gambler would spread upon a smooth, level grass plat a large, well-dressed
         deer
         skin, upon which he would place in a semi-circular form, within convenient reach of
         the player, a
         half-dozen newly-made moccasins. The game consisted in the use of a large-sized bullet
         held in his
         hands and shown to those looking on and desiring to take part in the game, and then,
         in a hurried
         and very dextrous manner, placing his hand under each moccasin, leaving the bullet
         under one of
         them. Betting was then made as to which one of the moccasins the bullet was under.
         As the manner of
         shuffling the hands under each moccasin was done so rapidly and skilfully that it
         was impossible for
         the by-standers to see under which the bullet was left, it will thus be seen that
         the chances were
         largely in favor of the gambler.
      </p>
      <p>"The few whites inclined in this direction learned this game from the Indians, and
         after the removal
         of the latter from the country kept up the game, using private rooms and covered tables
         in place of
         grass plat and buckskin; and for want of moccasins, using caps, and changing the name
         from
         "moccasin" to "bullet." this game continued to be played to such an extent as to cause
         the
         legislature to enact a law making it a finable offense. This law, with the introduction
         of the more
         secret and convenient means of gambling still in use, soon caused the game of bullet
         to become one
         of the lost arts.†"

            "moccasin?"
