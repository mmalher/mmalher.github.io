      <h1>Two Graphic Hoosier Pictures</h1>
      <p id="first">[The two pictures here poetically presented of the Hoosier pioneer home are so akin
         that we thus
         reprint them as a pair. The "Hoosier's Nest," by John Finley, for many years the mayor
         of Richmond, was, perhaps, the first Indiana poem to win fame, and it is further distinguished
         by
         its introduction of the term "Hoosier" into literature. It was first published in
         1833 (not in 1830,
         as commonly stated), according to Mr. J. P. Dunn, as a Carrier s Address for the Indianapolis<i>Journal</i>, and after some revision by the author, became fixed in the form from
         which we here quote. The other, untitled poem, from a far more famous poet, James
         Whitcomb Riley, is
         practically unknown and is not to be found in any of the author's books. It was read
         before an old
         settler's meeting at Oaklandon, in 1878, and is reported in full in the Indianapolis<i>Sentinel</i> for August 5th (or 6th). Both the poems are considerably longer than here
         given, and take a wider range than the theme of the cabin home].

      <p>The Hoosier's Nest</p>
      <p>
         <p id="marg"><b>I</b></p>' told, in riding somewhere West, A stranger found a
         Hoosier's Nest, In other words, a buckeye cabin, Just big enough to hide Queen Mab
         in. Its
         situation, low but airy, Was on the borders of a prairie; And, fearing he might be
         benighted, He
         hailed the house, and then alighted. The Hoosier met him at the door. Their salutations
         soon were
         o'er; He took the stranger's horse aside And to a sturdy sapling tied. Then, having
         stripped the
         saddle off, He fed him in a sugar-trough.
      </p>
      <p>The stranger stooped to enter in, The entrance closing with a pin. And manifested
         strong desire To
         seat him by the log-heap fire, Where half-a-dozen Hoosieroons, With mush and milk,
         tin-cups and
         spoons, White heads, bare feet and dirty faces, Seemed much inclined to keep their
         places; But
         madam, anxious to display Her rough but undisputed sway, Her off-spring to the ladder
         led, And
         cuffed the youngsters up to bed.
      </p>
      <p>Invited shortly to partake Of venison, milk and Johnny-cake, The stranger made a hearty
         meal, And
         glances 'round the room would steal. One side was lined with divers garments, The
         other spread with
         skins of varmints; Dried pumpkins over-head were strung, Where venison hams in plenty
         hung; Two
         rifles placed above the door, Three dogs lay stretched upon the floor, In short, the
         domicile was
         rife. With specimens of Hoosier life.
      </p>
      <p>The host, who centered his affections On game and range and quarter-sections, Discoursed
         his weary
         guest for hours, Till Somnus' all-composing powers Of sublunary cares bereft 'em,
         And then I came
         away and left them. No matter how the story ended; The application I intended Is from
         the famous
         Scottish poet, Who seemed to feel as well as know it That burly chiels and clever
         hizzies Are bred
         in sic a way as this is.

      <p>Mr. Riley's Poem</p>
      <p>[This poem, we find, is in the <i>Sentinel</i> of Aug. 4, 1878.
      </p>
      <p>O' the vision like a mirage falls The old log cabin with its dingy walls And
         crippled chimney, with the crutch-like prop Beneath a sagging shoulder at the top;
         The coon skin,
         battened fast on either side; The wisps of leaf tobacco, "cut and dried"; The yellow
         strands of
         quartered apples hung In rich festoons that tangle in among The morning-glory vines
         that clamber
         o'er The little clapboard roof above the door; The old well-sweep, that drops a courtesy
         To every
         thirsty soul so graciously The stranger, as he drains the dripping gourd, Intuitively
         murmurs:
         "Thank the Lord!" Again, through mists of memory, arise The simple scenes of home
         before the eyes;
      </p>
      <p>The happy mother humming, with her wheel, The dear old melodies that used to steal
         So drowsily upon
         the summer air The house-dog hid his bone, forgot his care. And nestled at her feet,
         to dream,
         perchance, Some cooling dream of winter-time romance; The square of sunshine thro'
         the open door,
         That notched its way across the puncheon floor, And made a golden coverlet whereon
         The god of
         slumber had a picture drawn Of babyhood, in all the loveliness Of dimpled cheek and
         limb and linsey
         dress; The bough-filled fireplace and the mantel wide; The fire-scorched ankles stretched
         on either
         side, Where, perched upon its shoulders ‘neath the joist, The old clock hiccoughed,
         harsh and
         husky-voiced, And snarled the premonition, dire and dread, When it should hammer time
         upon the head;
         Tomatoes, red and yellow, in a row, Preserved not then for diet, but for show, Like
         rare and
         precious jewels in the rough, Whose worth was not appraised at half enough; The jars
         of Jelly with
         their dusty tops; The bunch of pennyroyal, the cordial drops; The flask of camphor,
         and the vial of
         squills; The box of buttons, garden seeds and pills; And, ending all the mantel's
         bric-a-brac, The
         old, time-honored "family almanack."
      </p>
      <p>And memory, with a mother's touch of love, Climbs with us to the dusky loft above;
         ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗
         Again we stretch our limbs upon the bed, Where first our simple, childish prayers
         were said, And,
         while without the merry cricket trills A challenge to the solemn whippoorwills, And,
         filing on the
         chorus with his glee, The katydid whets all the harmony To feather-edg of incoherent
         song, We drop
         asleep, and peacefully along The current of our dreams we glide away To that dim harbor
         of another
         day, Where brown Toil waits us, and where Labor stands To welcome us with rough and
         horny hands.
