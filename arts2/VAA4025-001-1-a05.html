      <h1><u>CONTRIBUTIONS</u>: The Laws of Indiana as Affected by the Present Constitution
      </h1>B W. W. T
      <p id="first"><i>Author of Thornton's Revised Statutes, The Gov't of the State of Indiana, etc.</i></p>
      <p>THE first Constitution of the State of Indiana was completed and adopted June 29, 1816, and the State was admitted to the Union
         the
         11th of the following December. The second Constitution was completed February 10,
         1851, and went
         into force the 1st day of the following November.
      </p>
      <p>The Constitution of 1851 was not secured without a struggle which extended over many
         years. The
         Constitution of 1816 provided that every twelfth year the question of calling a convention
         to revise
         or amend it should be submitted to the voters at the general election, held for the
         election of
         Govenor. The first twelfth year came in 1828, when only ten counties reported, 8,909
         votes being
         cast on the subject. Of these, 3,329 were in favor of and 5,580 against calling a
         convention. At the
         election in 1840 only 38 counties reported, and 41,823 votes were cast, 7,489 for
         and 34,334 against
         a convention.
         <p id="marg"><b>Antecedent Provisions of the Second Cons't'n</b></p>
      </p>
      <p>This provision of the Constitution requiring a vote every twelfth year was regarded
         as only
         directory, and not to prohibit a vote on the question of revising at any election
         held to elect a
         governor. Under this interpretation of that provision a vote was taken in 1846; votes
         cast, 62,018,
         with 33, 175 favoring, and 28,843 against. While a majority of all votes cast on the
         question was in
         favor of the convention yet the Constitution required that the number should be a
         majority of all
         votes cast at the election; and as 126, 123 were cast for the gubernatorial candidates
         the number
         voting in favor of the convention was not a majority of all votes cast at the election.
         In 1849 the
         question was a fourth time submitted, the result being a vote of 81,500 in favor of
         the convention
         to 57,418 against it—a majority of 6,612 votes over all votes cast at the election
         for all the
         candidates for any one office.
         <p id="marg"><b>Twelfth-year Proviso, Interpretation of</b></p>
      </p>
      <p>The causes that prompted the calling of the Constitutional Convention of 1850 are
         reflected in its
         provisions, and have left their  imprint on all subsequent
         legislation. The territorial laws were often very crude, and not infrequently is this
         also true of
         those adopted under the constitution of 1816. In 1824, 1832, 1838 and 1843 general
         revisions of
         these State laws took place. That of 1824 was almost wholly the work of Benjamin Parke,
         and was a
         marked improvement over the laws that preceded it, but the revisions of 1832 and 1838
         were largely
         re-prints of laws already enacted, while that of 1843 was so radical in form and introduced
         so many
         changes as to be quite unsatisfactory.
         <p id="marg"><b>Causes Leading to New Constitution</b></p>
      </p>
      <p>The first legislature after the adoption of the constitution of 1851 revised the entire
         body of our
         laws. That instrument required the appointment of commissioners to revise, simplify
         and abridge the
         rules, practice, pleadings and forms of the court, and to provide for abolishing distinct
         forms of
         action then in force, that justice might be administered in a uniform mode of pleading
         and the
         distinction between law and equity preserved.<sup>∗</sup> The constitution made it the
         imperative duty of the legislature to bring about these changes through the agency
         of a commission.
         It also authorized it to empower the commission to revise the entire body of our statute
         laws, but
         this the legislature reserved to itself.
         <p id="marg"><b>General Revision under New Constitution</b></p>
      </p>
      <p>One of the most noticeable differences in the legislation before and after the adoption
         of the new
         constitution is the manner in which statutes are amended. Under the old constitution
         they were
         frequently changed or amended by providing that a certain word or words in a certain
         line of a
         certain section in a certain act should be stricken out and certain other words inserted.
         This is
         the method still pursued by Congress. The practice creates great confusion, and it
         is not always an
         easy task to determine the effect of statutes after the amendment is made. Under our
         present method
         the amended section must be definitely referred in the amending act, and then the
         section as amended
         set out in full. Formerly, under decisions of the Supreme Court, it was necessary
         to set out in full
         the old section, and then in full the section as amended, but a later interpretation
         of the
         constitution by that court permits the omis 
         <ol>
            <li><sup>∗</sup>This may not express Mr. Thornton's exact meaning. There was some
               confusion in the copy here, and it was not possible to submit proof–<i>Ed.</i></li>
         </ol>sion of the old section, thus simplifying the process.
         <p id="marg"><b>Amendments under the New Constitution</b></p>
      </p>
      <p>Another noticeable change is that the laws with very few exceptions are of a uniform
         and general
         application throughout the State. Prior to 1851 our statute books were loaded down
         with special
         legislation. Every city was incorporated by a law particularly its own, and there
         was no general law
         for their incorporation until after that date. Towns were incorporated in the same
         way. A stranger
         entering a town or city was chargeable with notice of the laws of the place, and was
         bound to obey
         them, and yet he could not know what they were until he had examined the charter of
         the city or
         town. It was nothing uncommon to vacate a street or even an alley by special act of
         the legislature.
         Prior to 1851 a temperance wave had swept over the State, taking a stronger hold on
         the people in
         one locality than in another. The result was a great patchwork of statutes relating
         to the subject.
         In some counties prohibitory laws were in force, while in others a license was required.
         Even in the
         same county these differences prevailed, some of the townships being "dry" while others
         were
         "wet".
         <p id="marg"><b>Spec'l Legislation under Old Const.</b></p>
      </p>
      <p>There was no uniformity in the schools, the laws being as various with reference to
         the subject of
         public education as those concerning the sale of intoxicating liquors. The public
         schools were
         poor—far below the standard prevailing today. Practice and pleading in our court are
         now uniform,
         but before 1851 such was not the case. In a county in particular instances a certain
         practice had to
         be observed; in an adjoining one, another, and in a third still another. Even the
         practice in
         several townships of the same county before justices of the peace was not uniform,
         and a special law
         for the election of a justice of the peace in a particular township was not uncommon.
         Nor were the
         laws of taxation uniform. One county could levy a certain tax while another could
         not levy it; and
         this difference often extended to townships of the same county, or to cities and towns.
         <p id="marg"><b>Lack of Uniformity</b></p>
      </p>
      <p>There is also a vast body of legislation, of a date prior to 1851, that is called
         "private"
         legislation, because it is of a private and not a public character. Prior to 1847
         each corporation
         was incorporated by an act of the legislature pertaining to it alone, called the "charter".
         At the
         session of 1846-7 the first law of a general character for the 
         incorporation of voluntary associations was enacted, but it was limited in its scope.
         Academies,
         seminaries, colleges, private schools, libraries, railroads, manufacturing and trading
         companies of
         all kinds, planing mills, saw mills, and even brass bands were incorporated by private
         acts of the
         legislature. This practice became a great burden to that body. Thus at the five sessions
         prior to
         that of 1843-4 the number of octavo pages of the private laws were respectively 180,
         301, 365, 431
         and 636; while those of the general laws were respectively only 122, 92, 135, 164
         and 125. Within
         the eight years prior to 1846 more than four hundred private acts of incorporation
         were
         enacted.
         <p id="marg"><b>Private Legislation under Old Constitution</b></p>
      </p>
      <p>Under the old constitution the legislature could grant divorces, and 83 were granted,
         40 of them at
         the session of 1845-6. Under the present constitution none can be granted by this
         method. Under the
         present constitution each statute can embrace only one subject, and the subject-matter
         must be
         embraced within the title. There was no such requirement under the old constitution.
         The object of
         this provision is to prevent undesirable legislation slipping through, and to give
         all legislation
         as much publicity as is conveniently possible.
      </p>
      <p>Another reason for a new constitution was the resentment in the breasts of many toward
         the State Bank
         and its branches, and the monopoly it held in banking matters in the State. It had
         become a very
         lucrative source of income to its stock-holders, who were mostly influential Whigs,
         and the
         Democrats dreaded their influence in State affairs. Many of the latter, therefore,
         favored a
         revision of our banking laws so as to overthrow the bank. Still another reason, growing
         out of the
         disastrous State internal improvement legislation, was to adopt measures to prevent
         the lending of
         the State's funds or credit to private enterprises.
         <p id="marg"><b>Various Reasons for new Coast.</b></p>
      </p>
      <p>These were some of the features in our laws that brought about the calling of the
         convention of 1850.
         Others were the election of the judiciary and all State and county officers by popular
         vote;
         biennial instead of annual sessions of the legislature, and the election of members
         of the general
         assembly from single dstricts. The year 1850 was also the end of two decades of constitutional
         construction and revision in many of the States of the Union. That  fact had a decided influence in bringing about the call for a convention. In 1830
         Virginia had adopted a new constitution; in 1831, Delaware; in <i>1832</i>, Mississippi; in 1835. Michigan (although not admitted until 1837); in 1836, Arkansas; in 1838, Pennsylvania and Florida (although the latter was not admitted until 1845); in 1842, Rhode Island; in 1844,
         New Jersey; in 1845, Louisiana and Texas; in 1846, Iowa and New York; in 1848, Illinois and Wisconsin; in 1849, California; in 1850, Kentucky and Michigan. In Maryland, and Ohio the subject had been so much under discussion that in 1851 both these States adopted
         new constitutions.
         <p id="marg"><b>Movement in Other States</b></p>
      </p>
      <p>The laws enacted <i>at</i> the first session of the legislature after the adoption of the
         present constitution were decided improvement over previous statutes. Of course there
         were radical
         changes required by the new fundamental law, but even where no changes were so required
         many were
         made. There were many improvements upon the draft of the statutes, for the legislators
         had the old
         statutes-before them, and it was an easy thing to improve upon them. The general body
         of the law was
         made more certain, and in many instances not so complex.
         <p id="marg"><b>First Laws under New Constitut'n</b></p>
      </p>
      <p>The crown of the work of legal reformation was the two codes—the civil and the <i>criminal.</i> These were the work of the Commissioners of Revision, and well they did their work.
         New York, in 1846, had adopted a code of civil procedure—the first in this country—which served
         as a model for our revisers, as well as a model for many, other States since the adoption
         of our
         code. David Dudley Field, in many respects her greatest lawyer, had written her code,
         and the
         impress of his genius has been felt in many of the States of the Federal Union. The
         Indiana codes—especially the civil code—are models of legal writing. The commissioners that
         revised them in 1881 made few changes and added little to them, but what they did
         was an
         improvement. The new codes introduced great and radical changes in the practice of
         the law, sweeping
         away a brood of fictions and technicalities that rendered the practice uncertain,
         cumbersome and
         unnecessarily prolix. Strange as it may be, the reformation of our practice in the
         courts was
         brought about largely by the laity, and against the opposition of a majority of the
         members of the
         legal profession.
         <p id="marg"><b>New Civil and Criminal Codes</b></p>
      </p>
      <p>The statutes of our State are not as well written as those of some of the older States,
         nor as well
         as those of the United States, but there is a marked improvement in them in this respect
         over our
         early statutes. The Commissioners of Revision in 1881 presented to the legislature
         drafts of many
         statutes that failed to pass that body, which would not only have introduced many
         reforms into our
         legislation but greatly improved existing statutory law. Many of our statutes should
         be re-written
         and simplified. This is especially true of the school law, which is a mere hodge-podge
         of statutes
         enacted during the last thirty-seven years, often so obscure that no man can tell
         what the law is
         upon a particular question. In the writing of statutes one of the cardinal principles
         to be kept in
         view is that a statute with which the people <i>en masse</i> have to deal should be not
         only clear in its language, but explicit and minute in detail. Statutes that courts
         deal chiefly
         with may be more general in terms and omit details in many instances, the courts having
         the power to
         supply the latter often when necessary to carry out their provisions. Such a statute
         will not do,
         however, where the people <i>en masse</i> deal in minute particulars directly with its
         provisions. The civil and criminal codes are written in general terms, but the tax
         and Australian
         ballot laws are written in great detail, the language used in them being explicit
         and clear. They
         are models of statutory writing. The laws on taxation and elections are not only a
         great advancement
         over the laws of the past on those subjects, but are much better and more clearly
         written than those
         of the past.
         <p id="marg"><b>On the Writing of Statutes</b></p>
      </p>
      <p>Beginning with 1888 the volume of our legislation has annually been very large as
         compared with that
         of the previous years. Many statutes are now in force on subjects where prior to 1851
         none existed.
         This is due to the condition of the country and the advance in civilization. There
         have arisen new
         conditions, new methods of doing business, new opportunities to commit crimes, and
         these had to be
         met. Necessity in old countries requires the statutes to be more numerous, more minute
         in detail,
         and usually more complicated than in new countries, and for this reason a new revision
         of our
         statute laws can be but a matter of time; though to undertake to secure such revision
         now would be a
         Herculean task.
