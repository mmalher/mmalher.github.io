      <h1>Indian Towns in Marion County</h1>
      <p id="first"> reference in the Tipton Journal to two Indian towns on White River between Conner's trading post and the
         bluffs, one in existence at that time and the other a tradition, is a contribution
         to an uncertain
         subject. The existence of a Delaware town in the north part of Marion County, near where Allisonville now stands, is recognized by Ignatius Brown and Berry Sulgrove
         in their histories, and the former tells of an old white woman who remained there
         after the tribe
         had left. This woman had been captured when a child, had reared a half-breed family,
         and her
         forgotten story seems to have been very like that of the more famous Frances Slocum.
         Very little
         information is to be had about this town, and it is treated, rather, as a tradition
         at the time of
         the first white occupancy. Tipton's statement, however, establishes that it was there
         in 1820.
      </p>
      <p>The town that once stood where the river crosses the south line of the county was
         still more a thing
         of vague report. Prof. Ryland T. Brown, in the <i> Geological Report</i> for 1882 (see p. 97) affirms, though without giving his
         authority, that it was the village of a Delaware chief named Big Fire, a friend to
         the whites; that
         it was destroyed by the Madison Rangers, in 1812, in revenge for the 
         <ol>

            </li>
         </ol> Pigeon Roost massacre, and that Governor Harrison had no little
         trouble in pacifying the chief. Incidentally it may be surmised that Tipton, who was,
         presumably,
         familiar with the local military operations of that period, and who had himself campaigned
         here in
         1813, as evidenced by his journal, would have know of the Madison Rangers affair;
         and William
         Landers' testimony added to this pretty well negatives Prof. Brown's assertion.
      </p>
      <p>In the <i> News</i> for May 4, 1899, appeared an article gleaned from C. T. Dollarhide, of Indianapolis, which recounted the tradition of the neighborhood in question as handed down by
         the
         narrator's grandfather, John Dollarhide, and other early settlers. Taken in connection
         with Tipton's information, and by its internal evidence of traditionary genuineness, it would
         seem
         to have more authenticity than any other statement upon the subject, and so much of
         the interview as
         has a documentary value we here repeat.
      </p>
      <p>Says Mr. Dollarhide: "My grandfather, John Dollarhide, settled near the meeting point
         of Johnson,
         Morgan and Marion counties in the year 1819 or 1820. His reason for settling there
         was that he found
         a considerable area of land from which the great forest trees had been removed. This
         had again been
         covered by bushes and small timber such as the settlers called second growth. That
         clearing, my
         grandfather said, had been made by Indians, and that ground had evidently been cultivated
         by them.
         My father said that after heavy showers he and his brothers had picked up Indian ornaments
         of
         silver, such as were worn on the breasts of braves (a kind of brooch) and other trinkets.
         When my
         father was a boy this place was called ‘the battle ground’, and is so called by some
         old people
         to-day. Tradition said that some time early in this century, or at the close of the
         last century, a
         party of Kentuckians had come to this Indian settlement and murdered the inhabitants.
         It was said
         that there was at this place (the land, I believe, now belongs, in part, to the estate
         of the late
         Eli Stone) a Catholic mission of some kind, probably a Jesuit mission; but whether
         the Jesuits were
         there when the massacre took place is not a part of the tradition.
      </p>
      <p>"In 1876 I became acquainted with Judge Franklin Hardin, who settled in Johnson County about 1820. When he heard my name, Dollarhide, he remarked that I must have come
         from
         the  ‘battle-ground,' and I found that he had known my
         grandfather in Kentucky. The Judge said that a relative of his, a Major Hardin, of Kentucky, had told him of an expedition that was led against this Indian village; that there
         was
         then, or had been, a French mission there, and that the Indians had been massacred
         in regular Kentucky fashion. The Judge said, I believe, that his relative had told him of this massacre
         in Kentucky before he removed to Indiana, and that he (the Judge) had no doubt that the
         ‘battle-ground’ was the identical spot of which the Major had told him. The Major,
         it was said, had
         taken part in this raid, which the Judge thought took place about the year 1795.<sup>∗</sup></p>
      <p>"In 1863, while making the Indianapolis &amp; Waverly gravel road, the workmen, digging into a gravel bank, threw out a
         number of human bones. It is not too curious to connect these bones with that massacre.
         ∗ ∗ My
         father told me that he had found a piece of stone-work there—an arch, I believe—and
         that he was
         certain that this piece, which was skilfully cut, could only have been fashioned by
         a white man, and
         that it may have formed some part of the French mission building."†
