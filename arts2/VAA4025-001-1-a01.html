      <h1>Our Reasons for Being.</h1>
      <p id="first">BY way of introducing this magazine and justifying its existence we cannot, perhaps,
         do better than
         repeat, in substance, what was said in a <i>Prospectus</i> recently issued by us.
      </p>
      <p>That the historical material of Indiana has never been adequately preserved and rendered
         accessible
         is a fact patent to all who have occasion to deal with such material. The dereliction
         of the State
         itself in the earlier days in caring even for its official documents exemplifies a
         neglect that has
         been general. By way of illustration, on the old statute books stand laws that require
         the
         preservation in the State Library of a number of copies of the general and local laws,
         and of the
         Senate, House and Documentary Journals; that require the careful indexing of the Documentary
         Journals; that require the alphabetical arrangement and binding into volumes of bills,
         petitions and
         other legislative papers. No efforts seem to have been made until later years to obey
         any of these
         statutory requirements, and so far as the culpable neglect has been rectified it was
         by the
         collections and clerical efforts of recent librarians. Even with these efforts complete
         sets of our
         State documents have not been secured, and much other matter of value has passed away
         beyond
         recovery.
         <p id="marg"><b>Early Neglect of Documentary Material</b></p>
      </p>
      <p>Much material not within the jurisdiction of the State has also passed away and is
         daily passing. Old
         men who have had a part in the history of the commonwealth die, and with them is going
         the last
         dwindling remnant of first-hand knowledge of the phases of life that have been; they
         leave papers,
         journals and various documents of interest, and these, descending to indifferent heirs,
         become
         irretrievably lost. To gather from surviving pioneers their testimonies, and to save
         from oblivion
         documents still accessible is a thing to be desired.
         <p id="marg"><b>Present Preventable Losses.</b></p>
      </p>
      <p>An interest in these things in this State sufficient to support a magazine of local
         history is only a
         matter of time. Such interest is not a sporadic one but a natural growth. Already
         something like a
         score of States are represented by as many periodical historical 
         publications, a number of them quarterly magazines, devoted to the preservation of
         local material.
         Some of these, such as Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, are younger States than ours with, perhaps, less history to record. Most of the
         publications mentioned have back of them the Historical Societies of their several
         States. We,
         unfortunately can look to no central organization for such support, but local societies
         are
         springing up in a number of counties, and if these will evince an interest proportionate
         to the
         service we can render them they can go far toward making our publication a success.
         <p id="marg"><b>Awakening Interest in Other States.</b></p>
      </p>
      <p>To the members of these societies and to others who think an interest in our past
         worth promoting as
         of value to the present, then, we make an appeal. We have launched the magazine at
         a venture and at
         some sacrifice in the faith that if we can make a worthy showing the support will
         be forthcoming. It
         is not our disposition to resort to any foisting or booming method. We assume that
         the class we
         desire and hope to reach will take our effort exactly at its worth, and that if every
         page we
         present to them is full of matter that justifies itself no better advertisement will
         be needed. For
         the first year, if need be, we are willing to make no account of managerial and editorial
         labors if
         the actual cost of publishing, distributing and associated expenses are covered.
      </p>
      <p>This, of course, is experimental and is by no means the limit of our hope. If our
         success justifies
         it we shall certainly expand our scheme. One feature much to be desired, but prohibited
         in the start
         by cost, is the reproduction of old maps and cuts of interest, many of which exist
         but are lost to
         all but the delver.
      </p>
      <p>The publication will be strictly what it purports to be at the start—a magazine devoted
         to the
         preservation and collating of matter that is of real value to the historical student.
         There will be
         no space given to advertising "writeings," and no cheap padding. Of matter within
         its legitimate
         field there is an abundance, and outside of this field it will make no bid for popular
         favor.
         <p id="marg"><b>Character and S$$ of Publication.</b></p>
      </p>
      <p>Its intended scope (subject to extension, as may seem advisable) is—</p>
      <ol>
         <li>The seeking out and publishing of hitherto unprinted documents that have an historical
            value.
         </li>
         <li>The re-printing of valuable and interesting matter that is buried away and practically
            lost in
            old newspaper files. Of this  there is much that is wholly
            forgotten, and, owing to the absence of any guide, to be found only after long and
            patient
            research.
         </li>
         <li>The conducting of a department of bibliography of historical material now scattered
            through
            periodicals and local histories, and of an indexing system that shall comprehend all
            important
            official publications besides other matter of interest. We believe that this will
            at once
            commend itself to all who have had occasion to search out obscure information.
         </li>
         <li>The binding together into a co-operative system (and this is one of the important
            and hopeful
            objects) the various local historical societies in the State, as well as the encouraging
            and
            promoting of other such societies. The needful thing in Indiana today, in this direction, is the historical "atmosphere," that shall stimulate work
            all along the line and inspire the student in history with a sense of the usefulness
            of such
            study. This once existing there is no reason why much should not be accomplished,
            and it is to
            those who have already started societies and otherwise manifested an interest that
            we must look
            for the creation of such an atmosphere by the uniting of their efforts.
         </li>
         <li>The publication of original studies in Indiana history by careful and trustworthy students. Some of the best history work being
            done at present is intensive, dealing with special aspects and of limited compass,
            but, by a
            corresponding thoroughness, particularly illustrative of great principles. Of work
            of this
            character we can secure enough to add a desirable feature to our plan.
         </li>
         <li>The promoting of history work, particularly State and local history, among teachers
            and in the
            schools. On this point we wish to be distinctly understood. The habit of "working"
            the schools
            as a lucrative field with many and various private enterprises is an evil conspicuous,
            we
            presume, to most school officials, and obvious to us. We have no intention of attempting
            to
            persuade teachers and trustees as to their needs—they themselves should know their
            needs better
            than we do—but this we have in mind: the interest in home history is making way in
            the schools;
            in the development of this interest and the directing of it to the most useful ends
            help and
            co-operation not available hitherto will surely be a need. Such help and co-operation
            we are
            ready to extend to the best of our ability.
         </li>
      </ol>
      <p>To sum up, we feel quite satisfied that we can carry out acceptably and well our proposed
         venture if
         our friends encourage it, and we hope to receive this encouragement.
