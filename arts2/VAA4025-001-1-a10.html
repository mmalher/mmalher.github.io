      <h1><u>LITERARY:</u> The Secession of Dixie
      </h1>
      <h1>A Story</h1>
      <p id="first">T "Secession of Dixie" may be taken as story or as history—just as you choose
         about that. On this point 
         <p id="marg"><b>I</b></p> will merely say I have read some history that was
         further from fact—and in that I commit myself to nothing.
      </p>
      <p>"Dixie," indeed, is no myth. From the well-tilled fields now occupying its site you
         may see the smoke
         of Indianapolis, and even, when that smoke permits, discern the great Soldiers' Monument which so
         majestically commemorates the Union that Dixie wanted to draw out of. I can remember
         when those
         fields (just a quarter-section in extent) were covered by a wilderness so dense that
         one who entered
         there was glad to avail himself of narrow winding paths that threaded the place, Indian
         trail
         fashion. These paths led to little log cabins here and there, surrounded by as many
         scant cleared
         spaces devoted in a rude way to garden truck, and occupied by uncouth, half-clad people.
      </p>
      <p>This ground, so runs the tradition, had at an early day been entered by one John Pogue,
         a Virginian,
         who, for some reason, let it remain in its primitive condition while the country around
         was
         improved. Then when the Rebellion broke out he hied himself elsewhere; his land was
         promptly
         confiscated as the property of an enemy, and once more it became government territory.
         Then came the
         squatters—the poor folk who are looking for land to live on without money and without
         price. A Mr.
         Jabez Baughman took the initiative, and others promptly followed; the government was
         too much
         occupied with weightier affairs, just then, to care much about it, and ere long a
         score or so of
         families had established themselves here in as many little openings, making a small
         community, quite
         cut off from the rest of the world. Quite cut off, I say, because something other
         than mere walls of
         woodland isolated them. They were, without exception, Southerners, of the kind known
         as "poor white
         trash"—victims of the vicious labor system of the South, haters of "niggers," and
         yet with a warm,
         unreasoning loyalty for their native States that had done so little for them and their
         kind.
         Alienated from their neighbors thus by sentiment it is no wonder, then, that when
         so excellent an
         opportunity offered they should segregate into a neighborhood of their own, and it
         was because  of the character of this settlement and the former "secesh"
         owner that the place came to be known as "Dixie". And by this opportunity the squatters
         found
         themselves very happily situated, for while the "butternuts" hereabout as a rule had
         to sing small
         and carry their sentiments up the sleeve, these could congregate and express themselves
         as often and
         freely as they chose with none to make afraid. Stray newspapers carried in like bones
         into a den to
         be feasted on at leisure, passed from hand to hand and so kept them apprised of the
         doings of the
         outside world. When, in the course of time, the fierce war tide lashed to and fro
         like the swing of
         an angry sea, and the rebellious murmurings of disaffected Northerners grew more pronounced,
         Dixie
         plucked up hope and began to dream of a day when the chivalry from the southland would
         sweep the
         country like a besom. Then suddenly, borne on the wings of excited rumor, came the
         report that the
         dashing John Morgan and his gallant battalions were actually bound hither like gay-hearted
         knights
         on a holiday jaunt. The secret order of the Sons of Liberty, rumor further hinted,
         would burst its
         chrysalis and come forth boldly to the light; the order of things would be all changed.
         There was
         excitement in the air. The whole State set to buzzing like a vast hornet's nest, there
         was a swift
         gathering of the clans, and on all sides was the busy notes of preparation for conflict.
         Something
         was going to happen.
      </p>
      <p>And now one day Mr. Jabez Baughman "issued a call" for all Dixieites to convene at
         his cabin that
         evening to discuss questions of moment. Of the resultant meeting no minutes were preserved;
         you will
         find no mention of it in the Adjutant-General's reports, nor elsewhere, and the only
         authority I can
         claim for it is the oral account of Mr. Andrew Jackson Strickler, a "member of the
         convention," who
         afterward became reconstructed and reconciled to the Government. As faithfully as
         I can quote him
         here he is, Tennesee dialect and all:
      </p>
      <p>"It was," said Mr. Strickler, "in July of '63. I disremember adzactly the date, but
         it was after the
         hayin' was done an' the wheat harvest about over. We heerd tell o' John Morgan crossin'
         the river
         an' headin' our way, an' was consid'ble intrusted like, an' so w'en Jabe Baughman's
         boys went eroun'
         the settlement tellin' all the men folks their pap wanted us to meet at their house
         late that night,
         we jest natchally fell in with it, kase we knowed from  the sly
         way it 'as done thar was somepin' up. None of us was to come till after ord'nary bed-time,
         an' none
         of us was to carry 'ary light, an' that putt ginger in it, y' see. Well, w'en night
         fell the the
         weather got ugly, and I mind way about ten o'clock, as I felt my way through the thickets,
         how
         everlastin' black it was, an' how the wind rasseled the trees erbout, roarin' like
         a hongry lion
         seekin' who he may devour. It made me feel kind 'o creepy, kase it 'peared like the
         elerments an'
         man an' everthing was erbout to do somepin'—kinder like the bottom was goin' to drap
         out 'o things,
         y'understand.
      </p>
      <p>"Well, the fellers come steerin' into Jabes' one by one, an' by 'leven o' the clock
         ever' man in
         Dixie was thar. Jabe's young'uns an' womern folks hed been sent out in the stable
         to sleep, an' so
         ever'thing was clear fer business, but we all set eround talkin' hogs fer a spell,
         kase we felt a
         mite unsartin; but byme-by Baughman, says he: ‘Gen'l'men, I call this yere meetin'
         to order.' Then
         my oldest boy, whose name was Andy, too, and who'd been to two or three public meetin's
         before an'
         felt kind o' biggoty over it, he hollers out: ‘I second the motion.' Then young Jerry
         Stimson says:
         ‘I move that Mr. Baughman take the cheer,' an' my boy seconded that, too, an' it was
         so ordered.
         Then Baughman riz an' said he hadn't hardly expected that honor (w'ich was a lie),
         but sence they
         had putt it on him he'd try to discharge his duties to the meetin'.
      </p>
      <p>"After that we made young Stimson secatary, seein' he was somepin' of a scholard,
         an' then Jabe he
         made us a speech sayin' as how we'd orto stick by the grand old South, w'at was even
         now sendin' her
         conquerin' hosts to our doors, an' how we'uns should be ready to receive her to our
         buzzums. It
         wa'nt all quite clear to me, an' I ast how we was goin' to take her to our buzzums.
         'W'y, give her
         our moral s'port,' says Jabe. ‘How'll we give our moral s'port, says I,' an' then
         says Jabe, slow
         an' solemn like: ‘Gen'l'men,' says he, ‘w'en our sister States found it was time fer
         'em to be up
         an' adoin'—w'en they found the Union wa'nt the place fer 'em, w'at did they do?.'
         Here Jabe helt his
         fire, an' ever'thing was stock-still fer a spell, w'ile the wind howled outside. It
         'peared like no
         one hadn't the grit to tackle the question, an' Jabe had to do it hisself. ‘Gen'l'men,'
         says he, air
         we men enough to run risks for our kentry? W'en John Morgan's histed the flag of the
         grand ol'
         Confedercy over the Injeany State House who's goin' to come to their reward, them
         as helt back
         skeert, or them as give him their moral s'port?
      </p>
      <p>At this my boy Andy, who was gittin' all het up like with the idee o' doin' somepin',
         bellers out:
         ‘Mr. Cheerman, I move 'at we air all men, an' 'at we ain't afeerd to give the South
         our moral
         s'port.' Then Jabe grabbed the cow by the tail an' w'ipped her up. ‘Do I understand
         the gen'l'man to
         mean,' says he, that we'd orto do w'at our sister States hev done, an' draw out o'
         this yere Union,
         an' ef so, will he putt a movement to that effeck before the house?.
      </p>
      <p>"I make a move then,' says Andy agen, as bold as Davy Crockett, 'that we don't w'ip
         the devil eround
         the stump no more, but that we git out o' the Union an' we git out a-flyin.' I was
         right proud o'
         the boy, not kase I thought he had a durn bit o' sense, but kase he went at it with
         his coat off
         like a man bound to make his mark. That got all of us spunky like, an' nigh ever one
         in the house
         seconded the move. Then says Jabe: 'Gen'l'men, the question is before you, whether
         we will lend the
         Southern Confeder'cy our moral s'port an' foller our sister States out'n the Union.
         All in favor of
         this yere motion signify the same by sayin' aye'. ‘Aye!' says ever livin' soul with
         a whoop, fer by
         that time we shore was all runnin' in a flock. 'All contrarywise say no,' says Jabe,
         an' we all
         waited quiet fer a minute, kase that 'as the proper way, y' know, w'en all of a suddent,
         above the
         roar o' the wind outside, thar was a screech an' a tremenjus racket; the ol' house
         shuck like it was
         comin' down; the daubin' flew from the chinks, an' overhead it 'peared like the ol'
         Scratch was
         clawin' his way through the clabboards. Next he come a-tearin' at the floor of the
         loft above us,
         an' a loose board swingin' down hit Jabe a whack an' knocked the candle off'n the
         table, an' the
         next thing it was black as yer hat. Jabe, I reckon, was consid'able flustered, kase
         he gethered
         hisself up an' yelled: 'The Devil's after us—git out o' here, fellers!' An' you bet
         we got.
      </p>
      <p>"It tuck me a full hour to find my way home through the bresh, an' w'en I did git
         thar, at last,
         an' was tryin' to tell w'ich side o' the house the door was on, I bumped up agin Andy
         groopin'
         his way too. 'Andy,' says I, ‘I move we git in jest as quick as the Lord'll let us,'
         an' says
         Andy, ‘I second the motion'.
      </p>
      <p>"The next day w'en we went back to Baughman's to see w'at we cu'd larn we found a
         good-sized
         ellum had keeled over agin the roof-poles an' poked a limb down through the clabboards.
         It 'as
         never settled among us jest w'at it meant. Some said it 'as the Lord's way of votin'
         no agin our
         goin' out o' the Union, an' others allowed it was the Lord's way o' savin' us from
         our
         brashness, kase, as ever one knows, John Morgan didn't git to Injunoplis after all,
         an' as
         things turned out it wa'nt jest best fer us to be seceded, y' know."
