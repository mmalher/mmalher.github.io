      <h1><u>DOCUMENTARY</u>: The Journal of John Tipton
      </h1>
      <h1>Commissioner to locate Site for State Capital—1820</h1>
      <p id="first">[John Tipton, pioneer Indian fighter, soldier, legislator and United States Senator, was a striking example of a certain type that has impressed itself upon
         the
         early history of the western country of America. It is the pioneer type—the uncultured,
         unlettered
         man, the product of a rude society, who, by strong natural gifts has come to the fore
         and asserted
         himself with distinction among the leaders of the land. Tipton, born of pioneer stock
         on the Tennesee frontier, came to Harrison County, Indiana, in 1807, when 21 years old, and is said to have soon taken rank as a leader of the
         law
         and order forces in his neighborhood. Along with a local military company he joined
         General Harrison
         in the campaign against the Prophet's town in 1811, and in the famous battle of Tippecanoe
         acquitted
         himself notably. That he rose by gradual promotion, after this campaign, to the office
         of brigadier
         general is evidence of his military capacity. With the admission of Indiana as a State and the creation of State and local offices he was elected sheriff of
         Harrison County, and served as such until 1819, when he was chosen to represent his district in the
         legislature; and as representative he was re-elected in 1821. When, in 1820, commissioners
         were
         appointed to select a site for the permanent capital of the State, he was considered
         a proper man
         for this important task; he was also appointed a commissioner to act with an Illinois representative in fixing the dividing line between the two States; and in 1823
         President Monroe made him general agent for the Miami and Pottowattomie Indians within
         our borders.
         In 1831 he was elected by the legislature to fill out the unexpired term of U. S. Senator James Noble, and in 1833 he was re-elected for the full senatorial term He
         died
         in Logansport, April 5, 1839, aged 53 years.

      <p>Not the least interesting of Tipton's performances are the journals left by him, which
         throw a light
         on his character, revealing his precise and methodical habit and his keen attention
         to practical
         matters. Two of these journals are of particular value. These are, the journal of
         the Tippecanoe
         campaign and the one here published. Each is the most circumstantial account in existence
         of the
         events chronicled. Of the commissioners' work in locating the capital, there is practically
         no other
         document existent, the legislative reports being exceedingly meager. The original
         manuscripts, once
         owned by John B. Dillon, were found among his effects at his death, and are now in
         possession of Mr.
         John H. Holliday, of Indianapolis. They were published by him in the <i> News</i>, in 1879, the one here printed in the issue of April 17, and the
         Tippecanoe account on May 5. Otherwise they have been inaccessible to the public.

                  <li>†John Berry, whose cabin stood at the mouth of Sugar Creek, in Johnson
                     County, is deserving of notice as the man who cut a "trace" into the heart
                     of the wilderness which was the route of ingress for many of the first settlers
                     of Indianapolis and contiguous territory, Berry's Trace, as it was called, began at Napoleon, Ripley County, ran north-westward to Flat
                     Rock and Blue
                     River, thence northward beyond Berry's house, it would seem, for we are
                     told of its crossing the "Whetzel Trace" near the site of Greenwood. Nineveh Berry, a well-known citizen of Anderson, was a son of John
                     Berry, and for him, it is said, Nineveh Creek, in Johnson
                     County was named. See Nowland's <i>Early Reminiscences</i>, pp.

                        the commissioners, who was the founder of Connersville. These brothers, particularly William, were of great service to
                        the government in its dealings with the Indians of this region, and they
                        merit fuller biographies than have ever been written of them.

                        is not without interest to the student of arboriculture. In the first days
                        of Indianapolis some 200 acres within the donation known as the "caterpillar
                        deadening" was cleared of brush, fenced in and tilled as a common field. See
                        Holloway's <i></i>, p. 9. From Tipton's location at the time of making his note this
                        deadening was probably the one he saw. A little further on he speaks of
                        another deadening, mentioning that it was of sugar trees.

                     <li>†The McCormick settlement, at the mouth of Fall Creek, was one of three sites that the
                        commissioners seem to have had in mind beforehand. According to Nowland it
                        consisted of "four or five families, viz: Hardings, Wilson, Pogue and
                        McCormicks, all of whom had come that spring. Albert Wilson, a son of John
                        Wilson, has told the editor that his father, in company with the McCormicks
                        and George Pogue, came from Connersville, following an Indian trail that led from the Whitewater to a
                        White River ford at
                        the mouth of Fall
                        Creek. These settlers, as well as those at the "Bluffs" were, of
                        course, "squatters," as the country had not yet been opened for
                        settlement.

                        cut a trace from the Whitewater to this point, and was followed and joined
                        here by several other families. See Nowland's <i>Early
